<head>Invocation.<note place="foot">The MSS. vary very considerably in these
stanzas of invocation: many lines are
generally prefixed in which not only the
poet, but those who play the chief parts in
the poem are panegyrized. It is self-apparent
that they are not by the author
of the Rámáyan himself.</note></head>

<lg>
<l>Praise to Válmíki,<note place="foot"><p><q>Válmíki was the son of Varuṇa, the
regent of the waters, one of whose names
is Prachetas. According to the <hi rend='italic'>Adhyátmá
Rámáyaṇa</hi>, the sage, although a Bráhman
by birth, associated with foresters and
robbers. Attacking on one occasion the
seven Rishis, they expostulated with him
successfully, and taught him the <hi rend='italic'>mantra</hi>
of Ráma reversed, or <hi rend='italic'>Mará, Mará</hi>, in the
inaudible repetition of which he remained
immovable for thousands of years, so that
when the sages returned to the same spot
they found him still there, converted into
a <hi rend='italic'>valmík</hi> or ant-hill, by the nests of the
termites, whence his name of Válmíki.</q>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Wilson</hi>. <hi rend='italic'>Specimens of the Hindu
Theatre, Vol. I. p. 313</hi>.
</p>
<p>
<q>Válmíki is said to have lived a solitary
life in the woods: he is called both a <hi rend='italic'>muni</hi>
and a <hi rend='italic'>rishi</hi>. The former word properly
signifies an anchorite or hermit; the latter
has reference chiefly to wisdom. The two
words are frequently used promiscuously,
and may both be rendered by the Latin
<hi rend='italic'>vates</hi> in its earliest meaning of <hi rend='italic'>seer</hi>:
Válmíki was both poet and seer, as he is
said to have sung the exploits of Ráma by
the aid of divining insight rather than of
knowledge naturally acquired.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Schlegel</hi>.

<hi rend='italic'>Kokila</hi>, the Koïl, or Indian
Cuckoo. Schlegel translates <q>luscinium.</q></note></l>

<l>The Vedas<note place="foot"><p><q>Veda means originally knowing or
knowledge, and this name is given by the Bráhmans not to one work, but to the
whole body of their most ancient sacred literature. Veda is the same word which
appears in the Greek οίδα, I know, and in the English wise, wisdom, to wit. The
name of Veda is commonly given to four collections of hymns, which are respectively
known by the names of Rig-veda, Yajur-veda, Sáma-veda, and Atharva-veda.</q></p>
<p><q>As the language of the Veda, the Sanskrit, is the most ancient type of the English
of the present day, (Sanskrit and English are but varieties of one and the
same language,) so its thoughts and feelings contain in reality the first roots and
germs of that intellectual growth which by an unbroken chain connects our own
generation with the ancestors of the Aryan race,&mdash;with those very people who at the
rising and setting of the sun listened with trembling hearts to the songs of the Veda,
that told them of bright powers above, and of a life to come after the sun of their own
lives had set in the clouds of the evening. These men were the true ancestors of our
race, and the Veda is the oldest book we have in which to study the first beginnings
of our language, and of all that is embodied in language. We are by nature
Aryan, Indo-European, not Semitic: our spiritual kith and kin are to be found in
India, Persia, Greece, Italy, Germany: not in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Palestine.</q></p>

his remonstrances vain, he denounced a curse upon his son-in-law, in consequence of
which he remained childless and became affected by consumption. The wives of Chandra
having interceded in his behalf with their father, Daksha modified an imprecation which
he could not recall, and pronounced that the decay should be periodical only, not

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Obedient to his master's hest</l>

<l>The hermit took it from his hand,</l>

<l>And muttered low his secret prayer.</l>
<l>To spirits and to Gods he made</l>
<l>Libation of the stream, and strayed</l>
<l>Viewing the forest deep and wide</l>

<l>Close by the bank he saw a pair</l>

<l>An outcast fowler stole behind,</l>

<l>Her loved companion, quivering, dead,</l>
<l>His dear wings with his lifeblood red;</l>
<l>And for her golden crested mate</l>
<l>She mourned, and was disconsolate.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hermit saw the slaughtered bird,</l>
<l>And all his heart with ruth was stirred.</l>
<l>The fowler's impious deed distressed</l>
<l>His gentle sympathetic breast,</l>
<l>And while the curlew's sad cries rang</l>
<l>Within his ears, the hermit sang:</l>

<l>And laboured with the wondering thought</l>
<l>What was the speech his ready tongue</l>
<l>Had uttered when his heart was wrung.</l>
<l>He pondered long upon the speech,</l>
<l>Recalled the words and measured each,</l>
<l>And thus exclaimed the saintly guide</l>
<l>To Bharadvája by his side:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">With equal lines of even feet,</q></l>
<l>With rhythm and time and tone complete,</l>
<l>The measured form of words I spoke</l>

composed. It need scarcely be said that the derivation is fanciful.</note></l>
<l>And Bharadvája, nothing slow</l>

<l>A pupil sage of lowly mind,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then glorious Brahmá,<note place="foot">Brahmá, the Creator,
is usually regarded as the first person of the divine triad of India. The four heads
with which he is represented are supposed to have allusion to the four corners of the
earth which he is sometimes considered to personify. As an object of adoration Brahmá
has been entirely superseded by Śiva and Vishṇu. In the whole of India there is, I
believe, but one temple dedicated to his worship. In this point the first of the Indian
triad curiously resembles the last of the divine fraternity of Greece, Aïdes the brother
of Zeus and Poseidon. <q>In all Greece, says Pausanias, there is no single temple of
Aïdes, except at a single spot in Elis.</q> See Gladstone's Juventus Mundi, p.

<l>None for the task could be more fit,</l>
<l>For skilled were they in Holy Writ;</l>
<l>And so the great Rámáyan, fraught</l>
<l>With lore divine, to these he taught:</l>
<l>The lay whose verses sweet and clear</l>
<l>Take with delight the listening ear,</l>
<l>That tell of Sítá's noble life</l>
<l>And Rávaṇ's fall in battle strife.</l>

<l>When, half the hermit's grace to gain,</l>
<l>And half because they loved the strain,</l>
<l>The youth within their hearts had stored</l>
<l>The poem that his lips outpoured,</l>
<l>Válmíki kissed them on the head,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hermit ceased. The tuneful pair,</l>
<l>Like heavenly minstrels sweet and fair,</l>
<l>In music's art divinely skilled,</l>
<l>Their saintly master's word fulfilled.</l>
<l>Like Ráma's self, from whom they came,</l>
<l>They showed their sire in face and frame,</l>
<pb n="011"/><anchor id="Pg011"/>
<l>As though from some fair sculptured stone</l>
<l>Two selfsame images had grown.</l>
<l>Sometimes the pair rose up to sing,</l>
<l>Surrounded by a holy ring,</l>
<l>Where seated on the grass had met</l>
<l>Full many a musing anchoret.</l>
<l>Then tears bedimmed those gentle eyes,</l>
<l>As transport took them and surprise,</l>
<l>And as they listened every one</l>
<l>Cried in delight, Well done! Well done!</l>
<l>Those sages versed in holy lore</l>
<l>Praised the sweet minstrels more and more:</l>
<l>And wondered at the singers' skill,</l>
<l>And the bard's verses sweeter still,</l>
<l>Which laid so clear before the eye</l>
<l>The glorious deeds of days gone by.</l>
<l>Thus by the virtuous hermits praised,</l>
<l>Inspirited their voice they raised.</l>
<l>Pleased with the song this holy man</l>
<l>Would give the youths a water-can;</l>
<l>One gave a fair ascetic dress,</l>
<l>Or sweet fruit from the wilderness.</l>
<l>One saint a black-deer's hide would bring,</l>
<l>And one a sacrificial string:</l>
<l>One, a clay pitcher from his hoard,</l>
<l>And one, a twisted munja cord.<note place="foot">Saccharum Munja is a plant from
whose fibres is twisted the sacred string which a Bráhman wears over one shoulder after

<l>One in his joy an axe would find,</l>
<l>One braid, their plaited locks to bind.</l>
<l>One gave a sacrificial cup,</l>
<l>One rope to tie their fagots up;</l>
<l>While fuel at their feet was laid,</l>
<l>Or hermit's stool of fig-tree made.</l>
<l>All gave, or if they gave not, none</l>
<l>Forgot at least a benison.</l>
<l>Some saints, delighted with their lays,</l>
<l>Would promise health and length of days;</l>
<l>Others with surest words would add</l>
<l>Some boon to make their spirit glad.</l>
<l>In such degree of honour then</l>
<l>That song was held by holy men:</l>
<l>That living song which life can give,</l>
<l>By which shall many a minstrel live.</l>
<l>In seat of kings, in crowded hall,</l>
<l>They sang the poem, praised of all.</l>
<l>And Ráma chanced to hear their lay,</l>
<l>While he the votive steed<note place="foot">A description of an Aśvamedha
or Horse Sacrifice is given in Canto XIII. of this Book.</note> would slay,</l>
<l>And sent fit messengers to bring</l>
<l>The minstrel pair before the king.</l>
<l>They came, and found the monarch high</l>
<l>Enthroned in gold, his brothers nigh;</l>
<l>While many a minister below,</l>
<l>And noble, sate in lengthened row.</l>
<l>The youthful pair awhile he viewed</l>
<l>Graceful in modest attitude,</l>
<l>And then in words like these addressed</l>
<l>His brother Lakshmaṇ and the rest:</l>

</lg>
<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pair, with voices sweet and strong,</l>
<l>Rolled the full tide of noble song,</l>
<l>With tone and accent deftly blent</l>
<l>To suit the changing argument.</l>
<l>Mid that assembly loud and clear</l>
<l>Rang forth that lay so sweet to hear,</l>

<l>There reigned a king of name revered,</l>

<l>Well read in Scripture's holy page:</l>
<pb n="013"/><anchor id="Pg013"/>
<l>Upon his kingdom's weal intent,</l>
<l>Mighty and brave and provident;</l>
<l>The pride of old Ikshváku's seed</l>

<l>Peer of the saints, for virtues famed,</l>
<l>For foes subdued and passions tamed:</l>
<l>A rival in his wealth untold</l>
<l>Of Indra and the Lord of Gold.</l>
<l>Like Manu first of kings, he reigned,</l>
<l>And worthily his state maintained.</l>
<l>For firm and just and ever true</l>
<l>Love, duty, gain he kept in view,</l>
<l>And ruled his city rich and free,</l>
<l>Like Indra's Amarávatí.</l>
<l>And worthy of so fair a place</l>
<l>There dwelt a just and happy race</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With troops of children blest.</l>
<l>Each man contented sought no more,</l>
<l>Nor longed with envy for the store</l>

<l>And each man counted as his own</l>

<l>And every townsman might be seen</l>

<l>None deigned to feed on broken fare,</l>

<l>On every arm were bracelets worn,</l>

<l>None lived upon another's wealth,</l>
<l>None pined with dread or broken health,</l>

<l>High-souled were all. The slanderous word,</l>
<l>The boastful lie, were never heard.</l>
<l>Each man was constant to his vows,</l>

<l>No other love his fancy knew,</l>

<l>But splendid, just, and great of mind,</l>
<l>The childless king for offspring pined.</l>
<l>No son had he his name to grace,</l>
<l>Transmitter of his royal race.</l>
<l>Long had his anxious bosom wrought,</l>

<l><q rend="pre">A votive steed 'twere good to slay,</q></l>

<l>The wood shall be that hermit's home.</l>
<l>To him no mortal shall be known</l>

<l>And all the wondering world shall hear</l>

<l>Those best of Bráhmans shall reply:</l>

<lg>
<l>The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,</l>
<l>Unfolded at the king's behest</l>
<l>The plan the lords in council laid</l>
<l>To draw the hermit from the shade:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The priest, amid the lordly crowd,</q></l>
<l>To Lomapád thus spoke aloud:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Hear, King, the plot our thoughts have framed,</q></l>
<l>A harmless trick by all unblamed.</l>
<l>Far from the world that hermit's child</l>
<l>Lives lonely in the distant wild:</l>
<l>A stranger to the joys of sense,</l>
<l>His bliss is pain and abstinence;</l>
<l>And all unknown are women yet</l>
<l>To him, a holy anchoret.</l>
<l>The gentle passions we will wake</l>
<l>That with resistless influence shake</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hearts of men; and he</l>
<l>Drawn by enchantment strong and sweet</l>
<l>Shall follow from his lone retreat,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And come and visit thee.</l>
<l>Let ships be formed with utmost care</l>
<l>That artificial trees may bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sweet fruit deftly made;</l>
<l>Let goodly raiment, rich and rare,</l>
<l>And flowers, and many a bird be there</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the leafy shade.</l>
<l>Upon the ships thus decked a band</l>
<l>Of young and lovely girls shall stand,</l>
<l>Rich in each charm that wakes desire,</l>
<l>And eyes that burn with amorous fire;</l>
<l>Well skilled to sing, and play, and dance</l>
<l>And ply their trade with smile and glance</l>
<l>Let these, attired in hermits' dress,</l>
<l>Betake them to the wilderness,</l>
<l>And bring the boy of life austere</l>
<l><q rend="post">A voluntary captive here.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ended; and the king agreed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the priest's counsel won.</l>
<l>And all the ministers took heed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To see his bidding done.</l>
<l>In ships with wondrous art prepared</l>
<l>Away the lovely women fared,</l>
<l>And soon beneath the shade they stood</l>
<l>Of the wild, lonely, dreary wood.</l>
<l>And there the leafy cot they found</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where dwelt the devotee,</l>
<l>And looked with eager eyes around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hermit's son to see.</l>
<l>Still, of Vibháṇdak sore afraid,</l>
<l>They hid behind the creepers' shade.</l>
<l>But when by careful watch they knew</l>
<l>The elder saint was far from view,</l>
<l>With bolder steps they ventured nigh</l>
<l>To catch the youthful hermit's eye.</l>
<l>Then all the damsels, blithe and gay,</l>
<l>At various games began to play.</l>
<l>They tossed the flying ball about</l>
<l>With dance and song and merry shout,</l>
<l>And moved, their scented tresses bound</l>
<l>With wreaths, in mazy motion round.</l>
<l>Some girls as if by love possessed,</l>
<l>Sank to the earth in feigned unrest,</l>
<l>Up starting quickly to pursue</l>
<l>Their intermitted game anew.</l>
<l>It was a lovely sight to see</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those fair ones, as they played,</l>
<l>While fragrant robes were floating free,</l>
<l>And bracelets clashing in their glee</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A pleasant tinkling made.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With music filled the place</l>
<l>As 'twere some city in the sky</l>
<l>Which heavenly minstrels grace.</l>
<l>With each voluptuous art they strove</l>
<l>To win the tenant of the grove,</l>
<l>And with their graceful forms inspire</l>
<l>His modest soul with soft desire.</l>
<l>With arch of brow, with beck and smile,</l>
<l>With every passion-waking wile</l>
<pb n="017"/><anchor id="Pg017"/>
<l>Of glance and lotus hand,</l>
<l>With all enticements that excite</l>
<l>The longing for unknown delight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which boys in vain withstand.</l>
<l>Forth came the hermit's son to view</l>
<l>The wondrous sight to him so new,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gazed in rapt surprise,</l>
<l>For from his natal hour till then</l>
<l>On woman or the sons of men</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ne'er had cast his eyes.</l>
<l>He saw them with their waists so slim,</l>
<l>With fairest shape and faultless limb,</l>
<l>In variegated robes arrayed,</l>
<l>And sweetly singing as they played.</l>
<l>Near and more near the hermit drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And watched them at their game,</l>
<l>And stronger still the impulse grew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To question whence they came.</l>
<l>They marked the young ascetic gaze</l>
<l>With curious eye and wild amaze,</l>
<l>And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang,</l>
<l>And shrill their merry laughter rang.</l>
<l>Then came they nearer to his side,</l>
<l>And languishing with passion cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Whose son, O youth, and who art thou,</q></l>
<l>Come suddenly to join us now?</l>
<l>And why dost thou all lonely dwell</l>
<l>In the wild wood? We pray thee, tell,</l>
<l>We wish to know thee, gentle youth;</l>
<l><q rend="post">Come, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He gazed upon that sight he ne'er</l>
<l>Had seen before, of girls so fair,</l>
<l>And out of love a longing rose</l>
<l>His sire and lineage to disclose:</l>
<l><q>My father,</q> thus he made reply,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Is Kaśyap's son, a saint most high,</q></l>
<l>Vibháṇdak styled; from him I came,</l>
<l>And Rishyaśring he calls my name.</l>
<l>Our hermit cot is near this place:</l>
<l>Come thither, O ye fair of face;</l>
<l>There be it mine, with honour due,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Ye gentle youths, to welcome you.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They heard his speech, and gave consent,</l>
<l>And gladly to his cottage went.</l>
<l>Vibháṇdak's son received them well</l>
<l>Beneath the shelter of his cell</l>
<l>With guest-gift, water for their feet,</l>
<l>And woodland fruit and roots to eat,</l>
<l>They smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,</l>
<l>Delighted with his courtesies:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">We too have goodly fruit in store,</q></l>
<l>Grown on the trees that shade our door;</l>
<l>Come, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste</l>
<l>The produce of our grove to taste;</l>
<l>And let, O good Ascetic, first</l>
<l><q rend="post">This holy water quench thy thirst.</q></l>
<l>They spoke, and gave him comfits sweet</l>
<l>Prepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;</l>
<l>And many a dainty cate beside</l>
<l>And luscious mead their stores supplied.</l>
<l>The seeming fruits, in taste and look,</l>
<l>The unsuspecting hermit took,</l>
<l>For, strange to him, their form beguiled</l>
<l>The dweller in the lonely wild.</l>
<l>Then round his neck fair arms were flung,</l>
<l>And there the laughing damsels clung,</l>
<l>And pressing nearer and more near</l>
<l>With sweet lips whispered at his ear;</l>
<l>While rounded limb and swelling breast</l>
<l>The youthful hermit softly pressed.</l>
<l>The pleasing charm of that strange bowl,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The touch of a tender limb,</l>
<l>Over his yielding spirit stole</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sweetly vanquished him.</l>
<l>But vows, they said, must now be paid;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They bade the boy farewell,</l>
<l>And, of the aged saint afraid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prepared to leave the dell.</l>
<l>With ready guile they told him where</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their hermit dwelling lay:</l>
<l>Then, lest the sire should find them there,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sped by wild paths away.</l>
<l>They fled and left him there alone</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By longing love possessed;</l>
<l>And with a heart no more his own</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He roamed about distressed.</l>
<l>The aged saint came home, to find</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hermit boy distraught,</l>
<l>Revolving in his troubled mind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One solitary thought.</l>
<l><q>Why dost thou not, my son,</q> he cried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Thy due obeisance pay?</q></l>
<l>Why do I see thee in the tide</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of whelming thought to-day?</l>
<l>A devotee should never wear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A mien so sad and strange.</l>
<l>Come, quickly, dearest child, declare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="post">The reason of the change.</q></l>
<l>And Rishyaśring, when questioned thus,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Made answer in this wise:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O sire, there came to visit us</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some men with lovely eyes.</l>
<l>About my neck soft arms they wound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And kept me tightly held</l>
<l>To tender breasts so soft and round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That strangely heaved and swelled.</l>
<l>They sing more sweetly as they dance</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than e'er I heard till now,</l>
<l>And play with many a sidelong glance</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="post">And arching of the brow.</q></l>
<l><q>My son,</q> said he, <q rend="pre">thus giants roam</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where holy hermits are,</l>
<l>And wander round their peaceful home</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their rites austere to mar.</l>
<l>I charge thee, thou must never lay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy trust in them, dear boy:</l>
<l>They seek thee only to betray,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="post">And woo but to destroy.</q></l>
<l>Thus having warned him of his foes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That night at home he spent.</l>
<l>And when the morrow's sun arose</l>
<pb n="018"/><anchor id="Pg018"/>
<l>Forth to the forest went.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Rishyaśring with eager pace</l>
<l>Sped forth and hurried to the place</l>
<l>Where he those visitants had seen</l>
<l>Of daintly waist and charming mien.</l>
<l>When from afar they saw the son</l>
<l>Of Saint Vibháṇdak toward them run,</l>
<l>To meet the hermit boy they hied,</l>
<l>And hailed him with a smile, and cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O come, we pray, dear lord, behold</q></l>
<l>Our lovely home of which we told</l>
<l>Due honour there to thee we'll pay,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And speed thee on thy homeward way.</q></l>
<l>Pleased with the gracious words they said</l>
<l>He followed where the damsels led.</l>
<l>As with his guides his steps he bent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That Bráhman high of worth,</l>
<l>A flood of rain from heaven was sent</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That gladdened all the earth.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vibháṇdak took his homeward road,</l>
<l>And wearied by the heavy load</l>
<l>Of roots and woodland fruit he bore</l>
<l>Entered at last his cottage door.</l>
<l>Fain for his son he looked around,</l>
<l>But desolate the cell he found.</l>
<l>He stayed not then to bathe his feet,</l>
<l>Though fainting with the toil and heat,</l>
<l>But hurried forth and roamed about</l>
<l>Calling the boy with cry and shout,</l>
<l>He searched the wood, but all in vain;</l>
<l>Nor tidings of his son could gain.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One day beyond the forest's bound</l>
<l>The wandering saint a village found,</l>
<l>And asked the swains and neatherds there</l>
<l>Who owned the land so rich and fair,</l>
<l>With all the hamlets of the plain,</l>
<l>And herds of kine and fields of grain.</l>
<l>They listened to the hermit's words,</l>
<l>And all the guardians of the herds,</l>
<l>With suppliant hands together pressed,</l>
<l>This answer to the saint addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The Angas' lord who bears the name</q></l>
<l>Of Lomapád, renowned by fame,</l>
<l>Bestowed these hamlets with their kine</l>
<l>And all their riches, as a sign</l>
<l>Of grace, on Rishyaśring: and he</l>
<l><q rend="post">Vibháṇdak's son is said to be.</q></l>
<l>The hermit with exulting breast</l>
<l>The mighty will of fate confessed,</l>
<l>By meditation's eye discerned;</l>
<l>And cheerful to his home returned.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A stately ship, at early morn,</l>
<l>The hermit's son away had borne.</l>
<l>Loud roared the clouds, as on he sped,</l>
<l>The sky grew blacker overhead;</l>
<l>Till, as he reached the royal town,</l>
<l>A mighty flood of rain came down.</l>
<l>By the great rain the monarch's mind</l>
<l>The coming of his guest divined.</l>
<l>To meet the honoured youth he went,</l>
<l>And low to earth his head he bent.</l>
<l>With his own priest to lead the train,</l>
<l>He gave the gift high guests obtain.</l>
<l>And sought, with all who dwelt within</l>
<l>The city walls, his grace to win.</l>
<l>He fed him with the daintiest fare,</l>

<l>Sumantra's counsel, wise and good,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">King Daśaratha heard,</l>

<l><q rend="post">My priestly guide, the plan allow.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vaśishṭha gave his glad consent,</l>

<l>With lords and servants on the road</l>
<l>That led to Rishyaśring's abode.</l>
<l>Forests and rivers duly past,</l>
<l>He reached the distant town at last</l>
<l>Of Lomapád the Angas' king,</l>
<l>And entered it with welcoming.</l>
<l>On through the crowded streets he came,</l>
<l>And, radiant as the kindled flame,</l>
<l>He saw within the monarch's house</l>
<l>The hermit's son most glorious.</l>
<l>There Lomapád, with joyful breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him all honour paid,</l>
<l>For friendship for his royal guest</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His faithful bosom swayed.</l>

<l>Seven days, or eight, he tarried there,</l>
<l>And then that best of men thus broke</l>
<l>His purpose to the king, and spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O King of men, mine ancient friend,</q></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his consent was won:</l>
<l>And then at once he turned away</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To warn the hermit's son.</l>
<l>He told him of their ties beyond</l>
<l>Their old affection's faithful bond:</l>
<l><q>This king,</q> he said, <q rend="pre">from days of old</q></l>
<l>A well beloved friend I hold.</l>
<l>To me this pearl of dames he gave</l>
<l>From childless woe mine age to save,</l>

<l>Moved by compassion's gentle touch.</l>
<l>In him thy Śántás father see:</l>
<l>As I am even so is he.</l>
<l>For sons the childless monarch yearns:</l>
<l>To thee alone for help he turns.</l>
<l>Go thou, the sacred rite ordain</l>
<l>To win the sons he prays to gain:</l>
<l>Go, with thy wife thy succour lend,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And give his vows a blissful end.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hermit's son with quick accord</l>
<l>Obeyed the Angas' mighty lord,</l>
<l>And with fair Śántá at his side</l>
<l>To Daśaratha's city hied.</l>
<l>Each king, with suppliant hands upheld,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gazed on the other's face:</l>
<l>And then by mutual love impelled</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Met in a close embrace.</l>
<l>Then Daśaratha's thoughtful care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before he parted thence,</l>
<l>Bade trusty servants homeward bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glad intelligence:</l>

<l>Glad were the citizens to learn</l>
<l>The tidings of their lord's return,</l>
<l>And through the city every man</l>
<l>Obediently his task began.</l>
<l>And fair and bright Ayodhyá showed,</l>

<l>Again the spring with genial heat</l>

<l>To win him sons, without delay</l>
<l>His vow the king resolved to pay:</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Prepare the rite with all things fit</q></l>
<l>As is ordained in Holy Writ,</l>
<l>And keep with utmost care afar</l>
<l>Whate'er its sacred forms might mar.</l>

<l>For our own people too provide</l>

<l>Of various viands presents make,</l>
<l>For honour, not for pity's sake,</l>
<l>That fit regard and worship be</l>

<l>And let not wish or wrath excite</l>
<l>Your hearts the meanest guest to slight;</l>
<l>But still observe with special grace</l>
<l>Those who obtain the foremost place,</l>
<l>Whether for happier skill in art</l>
<l>Or bearing in the rite their part.</l>

<l>And strangers there from distant lands,</l>
<l>And women folk in crowded bands</l>
<l>The best of food and drink obtained</l>
<l>At the great rite the king ordained.</l>
<l>Apart from all, the Bráhmans there,</l>
<l>Thousands on thousands, took their share</l>
<l>Of various dainties sweet to taste,</l>
<l>On plates of gold and silver placed,</l>
<l>All ready set, as, when they willed,</l>
<l>The twice-born men their places filled.</l>
<l>And servants in fair garments dressed</l>
<l>Waited upon each Bráhman guest.</l>
<l>Of cheerful mind and mien were they,</l>
<l>With gold and jewelled earrings gay.</l>
<l>The best of Bráhmans praised the fare</l>
<l>Of countless sorts, of flavour rare:</l>
<l>And thus to Raghu's son they cried:</l>
<l><q>We bless thee, and are satisfied.</q></l>

the nature of things, and the almost fraternal

<l>As texts prescribe, in Scripture found,</l>
<l>Three hundred victims there were bound.</l>
<l>The steed devoted to the host</l>
<l>Of Gods, the gem they honour most,</l>
<l>Was duly sprinkled. Then the Queen</l>

<l>The Jyotishṭom and Áyus rite.<note place="foot"><p>A minute account of these ancient
ceremonies would be out of place here. <q>Ágnishṭoma is the name of a sacrifice,
or rather a series of offerings to fire for five days. It is the first and principal
part of the Jyotishṭoma, one of the great sacrifices in which especially the juice of
the Soma plant is offered for the purpose of obtaining Swarga or heaven.</q>
<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Goldstücker's Dictionary</hi>.
<q>The <hi rend='italic'>Ágnishṭoma</hi> is Agni. It is called so because they
(the gods) praised him with this Stoma. They called it so to hide the proper meaning
of the word: for the gods like to hide the proper meaning of words.</q></p>
<p><q>On account of four classes of gods having praised Agni with four Stomas,
the whole was called <hi rend='italic'>Chatushṭoma</hi> (containing four Stomas).</q></p>
<p><q>It (the Ágnishṭoma) is called <hi rend='italic'>Jyotishṭoma</hi>, for they
praised Agni when he had risen up (to the sky) in the shape of a light
(<hi rend='italic'>jyotis</hi>).</q></p>
<p><q>This (Ágnishṭoma) is a sacrificial performance which has no beginning and no
end.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Haug's</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Aitareya Bráhmaṇam</hi>.</p>
<p>The Atirátra, literally <hi rend='italic'>lasting through the night</hi>, is a
division of the service of the Jyotishṭoma.</p>
<p>The Abhijit, <hi rend='italic'>the everywhere victorious</hi>, is the name of a
sub-division of the great sacrifice of the Gavámanaya.</p>
<p>The Viśvajit, or <hi rend='italic'>the all-conquering</hi>, is a similar
sub-division.</p>
<p>Áyus is the name of a service forming a division of the Abhiplava sacrifice.</p>
<p>The <hi rend='italic'>Aptoryám</hi>, is the seventh or last part of the
Jyotishṭoma, for the performance of which it is not essentially necessary, but a
voluntary sacrifice instituted for the attainment of a specific desire. The literal
meaning of the word would be in conformity with the
<hi rend='italic'>Prauḍhamanoramá</hi>, <q>a sacrifice which procures the
attainment of the desired object.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Goldstücker's

<p><q>The <hi rend='italic'>Ukthya</hi> is a slight modification of the Ágnishṭoma
sacrifice. The noun to be supplied to it is <hi rend='italic'>kratu</hi>. It is a Soma
sacrifice also, and one of the seven Saṇsthas or component parts of the Jyotishṭoma.
Its name indicates its nature. For <hi rend='italic'>Ukthya</hi> means <q>what refers
to the Uktha,</q> which is an older name for Shástra, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>
recitation of one of the Hotri priests at the time of the Soma libations. Thus this
sacrifice is only a kind of supplement to the Ágnishṭoma.</q>

dress the altar, slay the victims, and pour out the libations. 2. The choristers, who
chant the sacred hymns. 3. The reciters or readers, who repeat certain hymns. 4. The
overseers or bishops, who watch and superintend the proceedings of the other priests,
and ought to be familiar with all the Vedas. The formulas and verses to be muttered by
the first class are contained in the Yajur-veda-sanhitá. The hymns to be sung by the
second class are in the Sama-veda-sanhitá. The Atharva-veda is said to be intended for
the Brahman or overseer, who is to watch the proceedings of the sacrifice, and to
remedy any mistake that may occur. The hymns to be recited by the third class are

<l>When wisest Vishṇu thus had given</l>
<l>His promise to the Gods of heaven,</l>
<l>He pondered in his secret mind</l>
<l>A suited place of birth to find,</l>
<l>Then he decreed, the lotus-eyed,</l>
<l>In four his being to divide,</l>
<l>And Daśaratha, gracious king,</l>
<l>He chose as sire from whom to spring.</l>
<l>That childless prince of high renown,</l>
<l>Who smote in war his foemen down,</l>
<l>At that same time with utmost care</l>
<l>Prepared the rite that wins an heir.<note place="foot">The
Horse-Sacrifice, just described.</note></l>
<l>Then Vishṇu, fain on earth to dwell,</l>
<l>Bade the Almighty Sire farewell,</l>
<l>And vanished while a reverent crowd</l>
<l>Of Gods and saints in worship bowed.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch watched the sacred rite,</l>
<l>When a vast form of awful might,</l>
<l>Of matchless splendour, strength, and size</l>
<l>Was manifest before his eyes.</l>
<pb n="027"/><anchor id="Pg027"/>
<l>From forth the sacrificial flame,</l>
<l>Dark, robed in red, the being came.</l>
<l>His voice was drumlike, loud and low,</l>
<l>His face suffused with rosy glow.</l>
<l>Like a huge lion's mane appeared</l>
<l>The long locks of his hair and beard.</l>
<l>He shone with many a lucky sign,</l>
<l>And many an ornament divine;</l>
<l>A towering mountain in his height,</l>
<l>A tiger in his gait and might.</l>
<l>No precious mine more rich could be,</l>
<l>No burning flame more bright than he.</l>
<l>His arms embraced in loving hold,</l>
<l>Like a dear wife, a vase of gold</l>
<l>Whose silver lining held a draught</l>
<l>Of nectar as in heaven is quaffed:</l>
<l>A vase so vast, so bright to view,</l>
<l>They scarce could count the vision true.</l>
<l>Upon the king his eyes he bent,</l>
<l>And said: <q rend="pre">The Lord of life has sent</q></l>
<l>His servant down, O Prince, to be</l>
<l><q rend="post">A messenger from heaven to thee.</q></l>
<l>The king with all his nobles by</l>
<l>Raised reverent hands and made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Welcome, O glorious being! Say</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">How can my care thy grace repay.</q></l>
<l>Envoy of Him whom all adore</l>
<l>Thus to the king he spake once more:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The Gods accept thy worship: they</q></l>
<l>Give thee the blessed fruit to-day.</l>
<l>Approach and take, O glorious King,</l>
<l>This heavenly nectar which I bring,</l>
<l>For it shall give thee sons and wealth,</l>
<l>And bless thee with a store of health.</l>
<l>Give it to those fair queens of thine,</l>
<l>And bid them quaff the drink divine:</l>
<l>And they the princely sons shall bear</l>
<l><q rend="post">Long sought by sacrifice and prayer.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q>Yea, O my lord,</q> the monarch said,</l>
<l>And took the vase upon his head,</l>
<l>The gift of Gods, of fine gold wrought,</l>
<l>With store of heavenly liquor fraught.</l>
<l>He honoured, filled with transport new,</l>
<l>That wondrous being, fair to view,</l>
<l>As round the envoy of the God</l>
<l>With reverential steps he trod.<note place="foot"><p>To walk round an object keeping
the right side towards it is a mark of great respect. The Sanskrit word for the
observance is <foreign lang="sa" rend="font-style: italic">pradakshiṇá</foreign>, from
pra pro, and <foreign lang="sa" rend="font-style: italic">daksha</foreign> right, Greek
δεξίος, Latin dexter, Gaelic deas-il. A similar ceremony is observed by the Gaels.</p>
<p><q>In the meantime she traced around him, with wavering steps, the propitiation,
which some have thought has been derived from the Druidical mythology. It consists,
as is well known, in the person who makes the <hi rend='italic'>deasil</hi> walking
three times round the person who is the object of the ceremony, taking care to move
according to the course of the sun.</q></p>
<p><hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Scott</hi>. <hi rend='italic'>The Two
Drovers.</hi></p></note></l>
<l>His errand done, that form of light</l>
<l>Arose and vanished from the sight.</l>
<l>High rapture filled the monarch's soul,</l>
<l>Possessed of that celestial bowl,</l>
<l>As when a man by want distressed</l>
<l>With unexpected wealth is blest.</l>
<l>And rays of transport seemed to fall</l>
<l>Illuminating bower and hall,</l>
<l>As when the autumn moon rides high,</l>
<l>And floods with lovely light the sky.</l>
<l>Quick to the ladies' bower he sped,</l>
<l>And thus to Queen Kauśalyá said:</l>
<l><q>This genial nectar take and quaff,</q></l>
<l>He spoke, and gave the lady half.</l>
<l>Part of the nectar that remained</l>
<l>Sumitrá from his hand obtained.</l>
<l>He gave, to make her fruitful too,</l>
<l>Kaikeyí half the residue.</l>
<l>A portion yet remaining there,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He paused awhile to think.</l>
<l>Then gave Sumitrá, with her share.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The remnant of the drink.</l>
<l>Thus on each queen of those fair three</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A part the king bestowed,</l>
<l>And with sweet hope a child to see</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their yearning bosoms glowed.</l>
<l>The heavenly bowl the king supplied</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their longing souls relieved,</l>
<l>And soon, with rapture and with pride,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each royal dame conceived.</l>
<l>He gazed upon each lady's face,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And triumphed as he gazed,</l>
<l>As Indra in his royal place</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Gods and spirits praised.</l>

<l>These thousands did the Gods create</l>
<l>Endowed with might that none could mate,</l>
<l>In monkey forms that changed at will;</l>
<l>So strong their wish the fiend to kill.</l>
<l>In mountain size, like lions thewed,</l>
<l>Up sprang the wondrous multitude,</l>
<l>Auxiliar hosts in every shape,</l>
<l>Monkey and bear and highland ape.</l>
<l>In each the strength, the might, the mien</l>
<l>Of his own parent God were seen.</l>
<l>Some chiefs of Vánar mothers came,</l>
<l>Some of she-bear and minstrel dame,</l>
<l>Skilled in all arms in battle's shock;</l>
<l>The brandished tree, the loosened rock;</l>

<l>Disturb with their impetuous sweep</l>
<l>The Rivers' Lord, the Ocean deep,</l>

<l>Mad elephants that wander through</l>

<l>These were the leaders honoured most,</l>

<l>The leaders of the monkey band</l>

<l>They both endowed with Garuḍ's might,</l>
<l>And skilled in all the arts of fight,</l>

<l>Ever was Báli's special care;</l>

the itinerant organ-grinder or grins

Milton has made his hero, Satan, assume
the forms of a cormorant, a toad, and a

more ridiculous or undignified.</note></l>

<head>Canto XVII. Rishyasring's Return.</head>

<lg>
<l>Now when the high-souled monarch's rite,</l>
<l>The Aśvamedh, was finished quite,</l>
<l>Their sacrificial dues obtained,</l>
<l>The Gods their heavenly homes regained.</l>
<l>The lofty-minded saints withdrew,</l>
<l>Each to his place, with honour due,</l>
<l>And kings and chieftains, one and all,</l>
<l>Who came to grace the festival.</l>
<l>And Daśaratha, ere they went,</l>
<l>Addressed them thus benevolent:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now may you, each with joyful heart,</q></l>
<l>To your own realms, O Kings, depart.</l>
<l>Peace and good luck attend you there,</l>
<l>And blessing, is my friendly prayer;</l>
<l>Let cares of state each mind engage</l>
<l>To guard his royal heritage.</l>
<l>A monarch from his throne expelled</l>
<l>No better than the dead is held.</l>
<l>So he who cares for power and might</l>
<l>Must guard his realm and royal right.</l>
<l>Such care a meed in heaven will bring</l>
<l>Better than rites and offering.</l>
<l>Such care a king his country owes</l>
<l>As man upon himself bestows,</l>
<l>When for his body he provides</l>
<l>Raiment and every need besides.</l>
<l>For future days should kings foresee,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And keep the present error-free.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus did the king the kings exhort:</l>
<l>They heard, and turned them from the court</l>
<l>And, each to each in friendship bound,</l>
<l>Went forth to all the realms around.</l>
<l>The rites were o'er, the guests were sped:</l>
<l>The train the best of Bráhmans led,</l>
<l>In which the king with joyful soul,</l>
<l>With his dear wives, and with the whole</l>
<l>Of his imperial host and train</l>
<l>Of cars and servants turned again,</l>
<l>And, as a monarch dear to fame,</l>
<l>Within his royal city came.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next, Rishyaśring, well-honoured sage,</l>
<l>And Śántá, sought their hermitage.</l>
<l>The king himself, of prudent mind,</l>
<l>Attended him, with troops behind.</l>
<l>And all her men the town outpoured</l>
<l>With Saint Vaśishṭha and their lord.</l>
<l>High mounted on a car of state,</l>
<l>O'er canopied fair Śántá sate.</l>
<l>Drawn by white oxen, while a band</l>
<l>Of servants marched on either hand.</l>
<l>Great gifts of countless price she bore,</l>
<l>With sheep and goats and gems in store.</l>
<l>Like Beauty's self the lady shone</l>
<l>With all the jewels she had on,</l>
<l>As, happy in her sweet content,</l>
<l>Peerless amid the fair she went.</l>
<l>Not Queen Paulomí's<note place="foot">The consort of Indra,
called also Śachí and Indráṇí.</note> self could be</l>
<l>More loving to her lord than she.</l>
<l>She who had lived in happy ease,</l>
<l>Honoured with all her heart could please,</l>
<l>While dames and kinsfolk ever vied</l>
<l>To see her wishes gratified,</l>
<l>Soon as she knew her husband's will</l>
<l>Again to seek the forest, still</l>
<l>Was ready for the hermit's cot,</l>
<l>Nor murmured at her altered lot.</l>
<l>The king attended to the wild</l>
<l>That hermit and his own dear child,</l>
<l>And in the centre of a throng</l>
<l>Of noble courtiers rode along.</l>
<l>The sage's son had let prepare</l>
<l>A lodge within the wood, and there</l>
<l>While they lingered blithe and gay.</l>
<l>Then, duly honoured, went their way.</l>
<l>The glorious hermit Rishyaśring</l>
<l>Drew near and thus besought the king:</l>
</lg>

<pb n="030"/><anchor id="Pg030"/>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Return, my honoured lord, I pray,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Return, upon thy homeward way.</q></l>
<l>The monarch, with the waiting crowd,</l>
<l>Lifted his voice and wept aloud,</l>
<l>And with eyes dripping still to each</l>
<l>Of his good queens he spake this speech:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Kauśalyá and Sumitrá dear,</q></l>
<l>And thou, my sweet Kaikeyí, hear.</l>
<l>All upon Śántá feast your gaze,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The last time for a length of days.</q></l>
<l>To Śántá's arms the ladies leapt,</l>
<l>And hung about her neck and wept,</l>
<l>And cried, <q rend="pre">O, happy be the life</q></l>
<l>Of this great Bráhman and his wife.</l>
<l>The Wind, the Fire, the Moon on high,</l>
<l>The Earth, the Streams, the circling Sky,</l>
<l>Preserve thee in the wood, true spouse,</l>
<l>Devoted to thy husband's vows.</l>
<l>And O dear Śántá, ne'er neglect</l>
<l>To pay the dues of meek respect</l>
<l>To the great saint, thy husband's sire,</l>
<l>With all observance and with fire.</l>
<l>And, sweet one, pure of spot and blame,</l>
<l>Forget not thou thy husband's claim;</l>
<l>In every change, in good and ill,</l>
<l>Let thy sweet words delight him still,</l>
<l>And let thy worship constant be:</l>
<l>Her lord is woman's deity.</l>
<l>To learn thy welfare, dearest friend,</l>
<l>The king will many a Bráhman send.</l>
<l>Let happy thoughts thy spirit cheer,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And be not troubled, daughter dear.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These soothing words the ladies said.</l>
<l>And pressed their lips upon her head.</l>
<l>Each gave with sighs her last adieu,</l>
<l>Then at the king's command withdrew.</l>
<l>The king around the hermit went</l>
<l>With circling footsteps reverent,</l>
<l>And placed at Rishyaśring's command</l>
<l>Some soldiers of his royal band.</l>
<l>The Bráhman bowed in turn and cried,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">May fortune never leave thy side.</q></l>
<l>O mighty King, with justice reign,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And still thy people's love retain.</q></l>
<l>He spoke, and turned away his face,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, as the hermit went,</l>
<l>The monarch, rooted to the place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pursued with eyes intent.</l>
<l>But when the sage had past from view</l>
<l>King Daśaratha turned him too,</l>
<l>Still fixing on his friend each thought.</l>
<l>With such deep love his breast was fraught.</l>
<l>Amid his people's loud acclaim</l>
<l>Home to his royal seat he came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lived delighted there,</l>
<l>Expecting when each queenly dame,</l>
<l>Upholder of his ancient fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her promised son should bear.</l>
<l>The glorious sage his way pursued</l>
<l>Till close before his eyes he viewed</l>

<l>Wreathed with her Champacs'<note place="foot"><p>The <hi rend='italic'>Michelia

<l>Soon as the saint's approach he knew,</l>
<l>The king, to yield him honour due,</l>
<l>Went forth to meet him with a band</l>
<l>Of priests and nobles of the land:</l>
<l><q>Hail, Sage,</q> he cried, <q rend="pre">O joy to me!</q></l>
<l>What bliss it is, my lord, to see</l>
<l>Thee with thy wife and all thy train</l>

<l><q rend="post">For tidings both of thee and her.</q></l>
<l>Then joyfully, for due respect,</l>
<l>The monarch bade the town be decked.</l>
<l>The king and Rishyaśring elate</l>
<l>Entered the royal city's gate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In front the chaplain rode.</l>
<l>Then, loved and honoured with all care</l>

<head>Canto XIX. The Birth Of The Princes.</head>

<lg>
<l>The seasons six in rapid flight</l>
<l>Had circled since that glorious rite.</l>
<l>Eleven months had passed away;</l>
<l>'Twas Chaitra's ninth returning day.<note place="foot"><q>The poet
no doubt intended to indicate
the vernal equinox as the birthday of
Ráma. For the month <hi rend='italic'>Chaitra</hi> is the
first of the two months assigned to the
spring; it corresponds with the latter
half of March and the former half of
April in our division of the year. <hi rend='italic'>Aditi</hi>,
the mother of the Gods, is lady of the
seventh lunar mansion which is called
<hi rend='italic'>Punarvasu</hi>. The five planets and their
positions in the Zodiac are thus enumerated
by both commentators: the Sun
in Aries, Mars in Capricorn, Saturn in
Libra, Jupiter in Cancer, Venus in Pisces.…
I leave to astronomers to examine
whether the parts of the description agree
with one another, and, if this be the case,
thence to deduce the date. The Indians
place the nativity of Ráma in the confines
of the second age (tretá) and the third
(dwápara): but it seems that this should
be taken in an allegorical sense.…
We may consider that the poet had an
eye to the time in which, immediately
before his own age, the aspects of the
heavenly bodies were such as he has
described.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Schlegel</hi>.</note></l>

<l>'Tis meet and right in many a way</l>

<l>Thou grantest ere my tongue can speak.</l>

<l>O King, as Scripture texts allow,</l>
<l>A holy rite employs me now.</l>
<l>Two fiends who change their forms at will</l>
<l>Impede that rite with cursed skill.<note place="foot">The Rákshasas, giants,
or fiends who are represented as disturbing the sacrifice,

<l>These worst of fiends my toil defeat,</l>
<l>Throw bits of bleeding flesh, and o'er</l>

<l>When thus the rite is mocked and stayed,</l>
<l>And all my pious hopes delayed,</l>
<l>Cast down in heart the spot I leave,</l>
<l>And spent with fruitless labour grieve.</l>
<l>Nor can I, checked by prudence, dare</l>
<l>Let loose my fury on them there:</l>
<l>The muttered curse, the threatening word,</l>
<l>In such a rite must ne'er be heard.</l>
<l>Thy grace the rite from check can free.</l>
<l>And yield the fruit I long to see.</l>
<l>Thy duty bids thee, King, defend</l>
<l>The suffering guest, the suppliant friend.</l>
<l>Give me thy son, thine eldest born,</l>
<l>Whom locks like raven's wings adorn.</l>
<l>That hero youth, the truly brave,</l>
<l>Of thee, O glorious King, I crave.</l>
<l>For he can lay those demons low</l>
<l>Who mar my rites and work me woe:</l>
<l>My power shall shield the youth from harm,</l>

<l>And on my champion will I shower</l>
<l>Unnumbered gifts of varied power,</l>

<l>Be sure those fiends can never stand</l>
<l>Before the might of Ráma's hand,</l>
<l>And mid the best and bravest none</l>
<l>Can slay that pair but Raghu's son.</l>
<l>Entangled in the toils of Fate</l>
<l>Those sinners, proud and obstinate,</l>
<l>Are, in their fury overbold,</l>
<l>No match for Ráma mighty-souled.</l>
<l>Nor let a father's breast give way</l>
<l>Too far to fond affection's sway.</l>
<l>Count thou the fiends already slain:</l>
<l>My word is pledged, nor pledged in vain.</l>
<l>I know the hero Ráma well</l>
<l>In whom high thoughts and valour dwell;</l>
<l>So does Vaśishṭha, so do these</l>
<l>Engaged in long austerities.</l>
<l>If thou would do the righteous deed,</l>
<l>And win high fame, thy virtue's meed,</l>
<l>Fame that on earth shall last and live,</l>
<l>To me, great King, thy Ráma give.</l>
<l>If to the words that I have said,</l>
<l>With Saint Vaśishṭha at their head</l>

were twin deities of whom frequent mention is made in the Vedas and the Indian
myths. The Aśvins have much in common with the Dioscuri of Greece, and their mythical
genealogy seems to indicate that their origin was astronomical. They were, perhaps, at
first the morning star and evening star. They are said to be the children of the sun and
the nymph Aśviní, who is one of the lunar asterisms personified. In the popular
mythology they are regarded as the physicians of the Gods.</q>

counteract the austerities of man which threatened to prevail over them and to
deprive them of heaven.… Such austerities were called in India

<lg>
<l>When thus the sage without a peer</l>

<l>Ráma again the saint addressed</l>
<l>To set one lingering doubt at rest:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O holy man, 'tis said by all</q></l>
<l>That spirits' strength is weak and small:</l>
<l>How can she match, of power so slight,</l>
<l><q rend="post">A thousand elephants in might?</q></l>
<l>And Viśvámitra thus replied</l>
<l>To Raghu's son the glorified:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Listen, and I will tell thee how</q></l>
<l>She gained the strength that arms her now.</l>
<l>A mighty spirit lived of yore;</l>
<l>Suketu was the name he bore.</l>
<l>Childless was he, and free from crime</l>
<l>In rites austere he passed his time.</l>
<l>The mighty Sire was pleased to show</l>
<l>His favour, and a child bestow.</l>
<l>Táḍaká named, most fair to see,</l>
<l>A pearl among the maids was she,</l>

<l>A thousand elephants in power.</l>
<l>Nor would the Eternal Sire, although</l>
<l>The spirit longed, a son bestow</l>
<l>That maid in beauty's youthful pride</l>
<l>Was given to Sunda for a bride.</l>
<l>Her son, Márícha was his name,</l>

<l>Inflamed with hunger's wildest rage,</l>
<l>Roaring she rushed upon the sage.</l>
<l>When the great hermit saw her near,</l>
<l>On speeding in her fierce career,</l>
<l>He thus pronounced Márícha's doom:</l>
<l><q>A giant's form and shape assume.</q></l>
<l>And then, by mighty anger swayed,</l>
<l>On Táḍaká this curse he laid:</l>

<lg>
<l>Thus spoke the saint. Each vigorous word</l>
<l>The noble monarch's offspring heard,</l>
<l>And, reverent hands together laid,</l>
<l>His answer to the hermit made:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My sire and mother bade me aye</q></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the tamer of the foe,</l>

<l>Scared by the mighty clang the deer</l>
<l>That roamed the forest shook with fear,</l>
<l>And Táḍaká the echo heard,</l>
<l>And rose in haste from slumber stirred.</l>
<l>In wild amaze, her soul aflame</l>
<l>With fury toward the spot she came.</l>
<l>When that foul shape of evil mien</l>
<l>And stature vast as e'er was seen</l>
<l>The wrathful son of Raghu eyed,</l>
<l>He thus unto his brother cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Her dreadful shape, O Lakshmaṇ, see,</q></l>
<l>A form to shudder at and flee.</l>
<l>The hideous monster's very view</l>
<l>Would cleave a timid heart in two.</l>

<l>Defended by her magic might.</l>
<l>My hand shall stay her course to-day,</l>
<l>And shear her nose and ears away.</l>
<l>No heart have I her life to take:</l>
<l>I spare it for her sex's sake.</l>
<l>My will is but, with minished force,</l>
<l><q rend="post">To check her in her evil course.</q></l>
<l>While thus he spoke, by rage impelled</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roaring as she came nigh,</l>
<l>The fiend her course at Ráma held</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With huge arms tossed on high.</l>
<l>Her, rushing on, the seer assailed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With a loud cry of hate;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fearful fight to wage,</l>

<l>Assuming by her magic skill</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A fresh and fresh disguise,</l>
<l>She tried a thousand shapes at will,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then vanished from their eyes.</l>
<l>When Gádhi's son of high renown</l>
<l>Still saw the stony rain pour down</l>
<l>Upon each princely warrior's head,</l>
<l>With words of wisdom thus he said:</l>

<l>Then Ráma, skilful to direct</l>

<l>Sore wounded by the shaft that came</l>
<l>With lightning speed and surest aim,</l>
<l>Blood spouting from her mouth and side,</l>
<l>She fell upon the earth and died.</l>
<l>Soon as the Lord who rules the sky</l>
<l>Saw the dread monster lifeless lie,</l>
<l>He called aloud, Well done! well done!</l>
<l>And the Gods honoured Raghu's son.</l>
<l>Standing in heaven the Thousand-eyed,</l>

this Canto together with the following one, regards the belief,
formerly prevalent in India, that by virtue of certain spells, to be learnt and muttered,
secret knowledge and superhuman powers might be acquired. To this the
poet has already alluded in Canto xxiii. These incorporeal weapons are partly represented
according to the fashion of those ascribed to the Gods and the different
orders of demi-gods, partly are the mere creations of fancy; and it would not
be easy to say what idea the poet had of them in his own mind, or what powers he
meant to assign to each.</q>

<head>Canto XXXI. The Perfect Hermitage.</head>

<lg>
<l>Thus spoke the prince of boundless might,</l>
<l>And thus replied the anchorite:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Chief of the mighty arm, of yore</q></l>
<l>Lord Vishṇu whom the Gods adore,</l>
<l>For holy thought and rites austere</l>
<l>Of penance made his dwelling here.</l>
<l>This ancient wood was called of old</l>
<l>Grove of the Dwarf, the mighty-souled,</l>
<l>And when perfection he attained</l>
<l>The grove the name of Perfect gained.</l>
<l>Bali of yore, Virochan's son,</l>
<l>Dominion over Indra won,</l>
<l>And when with power his proud heart swelled,</l>
<l>O'er the three worlds his empire held.</l>
<l>When Bali then began a rite,</l>
<l>The Gods and Indra in affright</l>
<l>Sought Vishṇu in this place of rest,</l>
<l>And thus with prayers the God addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Bali. Virochan's mighty son,</q></l>
<l>His sacrifice has now begun:</l>
<l>Of boundless wealth, that demon king</l>
<l>Is bounteous to each living thing.</l>
<l>Though suppliants flock from every side</l>
<l>The suit of none is e'er denied.</l>
<l>Whate'er, where'er howe'er the call,</l>
<l>He hears the suit and gives to all.</l>
<l>Now with thine own illusive art</l>
<l>Perform, O Lord, the helper's part:</l>
<l>Assume a dwarfish form, and thus</l>
<l><q rend="post">From fear and danger rescue us.</q><note place="foot">I omit,
after this line, eight <hi rend='italic'>ślokes</hi>
which, as Schlegel allows, are quite out of place.</note></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in their dread the Immortals sued:</l>
<l>The God a dwarflike shape indued:<note place="foot">This is the
fifth of the <hi rend='italic'>avatárs</hi>, descents
or incarnations of Vishṇu.</note></l>
<l>Before Virochan's son he came,</l>
<l>Three steps of land his only claim.</l>
<l>The boon obtained, in wondrous wise</l>
<l>Lord Vishṇu's form increased in size;</l>
<l>Through all the worlds, tremendous, vast,</l>
<l>God of the Triple Step, he passed.<note place="foot">This is a solar allegory.
Vishṇu is the sun, the three steps being his rising,
culmination, and setting.</note></l>
<l>The whole broad earth from side to side</l>
<l>He measured with one mighty stride,</l>
<l>Spanned with the next the firmament,</l>
<l>And with the third through heaven he went.</l>
<pb n="044"/><anchor id="Pg044"/>
<l>Thus was the king of demons hurled</l>
<l>By Vishṇu to the nether world,</l>
<l>And thus the universe restored</l>
<l>To Indra's rule, its ancient lord.</l>
<l>And now because the immortal God</l>
<l>This spot in dwarflike semblance trod,</l>
<l>The grove has aye been loved by me</l>
<l>For reverence of the devotee.</l>
<l>But demons haunt it, prompt to stay</l>
<l>Each holy offering I would pay.</l>
<l>Be thine, O lion-lord, to kill</l>
<l>These giants that delight in ill.</l>
<l>This day, beloved child, our feet</l>
<l>Shall rest within the calm retreat:</l>
<l>And know, thou chief of Raghu's line,</l>
<l><q rend="post">My hermitage is also thine.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke; and soon the anchorite,</l>
<l>With joyous looks that beamed delight,</l>
<l>With Ráma and his brother stood</l>
<l>Within the consecrated wood.</l>
<l>Soon as they saw the holy man,</l>
<l>With one accord together ran</l>
<l>The dwellers in the sacred shade,</l>
<l>And to the saint their reverence paid,</l>
<l>And offered water for his feet,</l>
<l>The gift of honour and a seat;</l>
<l>And next with hospitable care</l>
<l>They entertained the princely pair.</l>
<l>The royal tamers of their foes</l>
<l>Rested awhile in sweet repose:</l>
<l>Then to the chief of hermits sued</l>
<l>Standing in suppliant attitude:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Begin, O best of saints, we pray,</q></l>
<l>Initiatory rites to-day.</l>
<l>This Perfect Grove shall be anew</l>
<l><q rend="post">Made perfect, and thy words be true.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, thus addressed, the holy man,</l>
<l>The very glorious sage, began</l>
<l>The high preliminary rite.</l>
<l>Restraining sense and appetite.</l>
<l>Calmly the youths that night reposed,</l>
<l>And rose when morn her light disclosed,</l>
<l>Their morning worship paid, and took</l>
<l>Of lustral water from the brook.</l>
<l>Thus purified they breathed the prayer,</l>
<l>Then greeted Viśvámitra where</l>
<l>As celebrant he sate beside</l>
<l>The flame with sacred oil supplied.</l>

<lg>
<l>That conquering pair, of royal race,</l>
<l>Skilled to observe due time and place,</l>
<l>To Kuśik's hermit son addressed,</l>
<l>In timely words, their meet request:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">When must we, lord, we pray thee tell,</q></l>
<l>Those Rovers of the Night repel?</l>
<l>Speak, lest we let the moment fly,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And pass the due occasion by.</q></l>
<l>Thus longing for the strife, they prayed,</l>
<l>And thus the hermits answer made:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Till the fifth day be come and past,</q></l>
<l>O Raghu's sons, your watch must last.</l>
<l>The saint his Dikshá<note place="foot">Certain ceremonies preliminary to a
sacrifice.</note> has begun,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And all that time will speak to none.</q></l>
<l>Soon as the steadfast devotees</l>
<l>Had made reply in words like these,</l>
<l>The youths began, disdaining sleep,</l>
<l>Six days and nights their watch to keep.</l>
<l>The warrior pair who tamed the foe,</l>
<l>Unrivalled benders of the bow,</l>
<l>Kept watch and ward unwearied still</l>
<l>To guard the saint from scathe and ill.</l>
<l>'Twas now the sixth returning day,</l>
<l>The hour foretold had past away.</l>
<l>Then Ráma cried: <q rend="pre">O Lakshmaṇ, now</q></l>
<l>Firm, watchful, resolute be thou.</l>
<l>The fiends as yet have kept afar</l>
<l>From the pure grove in which we are:</l>
<l>Yet waits us, ere the day shall close,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Dire battle with the demon foes.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus spoke Ráma borne away</l>
<l>By longing for the deadly fray,</l>
<l>See! bursting from the altar came</l>
<l>The sudden glory of the flame.</l>
<l>Round priest and deacon, and upon</l>
<l>Grass, ladles, flowers, the splendour shone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the high rite, in order due,</l>
<l>With sacred texts began anew.</l>
<l>But then a loud and fearful roar</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Re-echoed through the sky;</l>
<l>And like vast clouds that shadow o'er</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The heavens in dark July,</l>
<l>Involved in gloom of magic might</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two fiends rushed on amain,</l>
<l>Márícha, Rover of the Night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Suváhu, and their train.</l>
<l>As on they came in wild career</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick blood in rain they shed;</l>
<l>And Ráma saw those things of fear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impending overhead.</l>
<l>Then soon as those accursed two</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who showered down blood be spied,</l>
<l>Thus to his brother brave and true</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spoke Ráma lotus-eyed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now, Lakshmaṇ, thou these fiends shalt see,</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Man-eaters, foul of mind,</l>
<l>Before my mortal weapon flee</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="post">Like clouds before the wind.</q></l>
<l>He spoke. An arrow, swift as thought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Upon his bow he pressed,</l>
<l>And smote, to utmost fury wrought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Márícha on the breast.</l>
<l>Deep in his flesh the weapon lay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Winged by the mystic spell,</l>
<pb n="045"/><anchor id="Pg045"/>
<l>And, hurled a hundred leagues away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In ocean's flood he fell.</l>
<l>Then Ráma, when he saw the foe</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Convulsed and mad with pain</l>
<l>Neath the chill-pointed weapon's blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Lakshmaṇ spoke again:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">See, Lakshmaṇ, see! this mortal dart</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That strikes a numbing chill,</l>
<l>Hath struck him senseless with the smart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But left him breathing still.</l>
<l>But these who love the evil way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drink the blood they spill,</l>
<l>Rejoicing holy rites to stay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="post">Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill.</q></l>
<l>He seized another shaft, the best,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Aglow with living flame;</l>
<l>It struck Suváhu on the chest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dead to earth he came.</l>
<l>Again a dart, the Wind-God's own,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Upon his string he laid,</l>
<l>And all the demons were o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The saints no more afraid.</l>
<l>When thus the fiends were slain in fight,</l>
<l>Disturbers of each holy rite,</l>
<l>Due honour by the saints was paid</l>
<l>To Ráma for his wondrous aid:</l>
<l>So Indra is adored when he</l>
<l>Has won some glorious victory.</l>
<l>Success at last the rite had crowned,</l>
<l>And Viśvámitra gazed around,</l>
<l>And seeing every side at rest,</l>
<l>The son of Raghu thus addressed:</l>

<lg>
<l>Their task achieved, the princes spent</l>
<l>That night with joy and full content.</l>
<l>Ere yet the dawn was well displayed</l>
<l>Their morning rites they duly paid,</l>
<l>And sought, while yet the light was faint,</l>
<l>The hermits and the mighty saint.</l>
<l>They greeted first that holy sire</l>
<l>Resplendent like the burning fire,</l>

<l>Their sweet speech to the sainted man:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Here stand, O Lord, thy servants true:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Command what thou wouldst have us do.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The saints, by Viśvámitra led,</l>
<l>To Ráma thus in answer said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Janak the king who rules the land</q></l>
<l>Of fertile Míthilá has planned</l>
<l>A noble sacrifice, and we</l>
<l>Will thither go the rite to see.</l>
<l>Thou, Prince of men, with us shalt go,</l>
<l>And there behold the wondrous bow,</l>
<l>Terrific, vast, of matchless might,</l>
<l>Which, splendid at the famous rite,</l>
<l>The Gods assembled gave the king.</l>
<l>No giant, fiend, or God can string</l>
<l>That gem of bows, no heavenly bard:</l>
<l>Then, sure, for man the task were hard.</l>
<l>When lords of earth have longed to know</l>
<l>The virtue of that wondrous bow,</l>
<l>The strongest sons of kings in vain</l>
<l>Have tried the mighty cord to strain.</l>
<l>This famous bow thou there shalt view,</l>
<l>And wondrous rites shalt witness too.</l>
<l>The high-souled king who lords it o'er</l>
<l>The realm of Míthilá of yore</l>
<l>Gained from the Gods this bow, the price</l>
<l>Of his imperial sacrifice.</l>
<l>Won by the rite the glorious prize</l>
<l>Still in the royal palace lies,</l>
<l>Laid up in oil of precious scent</l>
<l><q rend="post">With aloe-wood and incense blent.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma answering, Be it so,</l>
<l>Made ready with the rest to go.</l>
<l>The saint himself was now prepared,</l>
<l>But ere beyond the grove he fared,</l>
<l>He turned him and in words like these</l>
<l>Addressed the sylvan deities:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Farewell! each holy rite complete,</q></l>
<l>I leave the hermits' perfect seat:</l>
<l>To Gangá's northern shore I go</l>
<l><q rend="post">Beneath Himálaya's peaks of snow.</q></l>
<l>With reverent steps he paced around</l>
<l>The limits of the holy ground,</l>
<l>And then the mighty saint set forth</l>
<l>And took his journey to the north.</l>
<l>His pupils, deep in Scripture's page,</l>
<l>Followed behind the holy sage,</l>
<l>And servants from the sacred grove</l>
<l>A hundred wains for convoy drove.</l>
<l>The very birds that winged that air,</l>
<l>The very deer that harboured there,</l>
<l>Forsook the glade and leafy brake</l>
<l>And followed for the hermit's sake.</l>
<l>They travelled far, till in the west</l>
<l>The sun was speeding to his rest,</l>
<l>And made, their portioned journey o'er,</l>
<l>Their halt on Śona's<note place="foot">A river which rises in Budelcund and

<l>The hermits bathed when sank the sun,</l>
<l>And every rite was duly done,</l>

<l>Sate round their chief the holy men.</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ lowly bowed</l>
<l>In reverence to the hermit crowd,</l>

<l>With humble palms together laid</l>
<l>His eager supplication made:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">There lived a sage called Chúli then,</l>
<l>Devoutest of the sons of men;</l>
<l>His days in penance rites he spent,</l>
<l>A glorious saint, most continent.</l>
<l>To him absorbed in tasks austere</l>
<l>The child of Urmilá drew near,</l>
<l>Sweet Somadá, the heavenly maid</l>
<l>And lent the saint her pious aid.</l>
<l>Long time near him the maiden spent,</l>
<l>And served him meek and reverent,</l>
<l>Till the great hermit, pleased with her,</l>
<l>Thus spoke unto his minister:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Grateful am I for all thy care:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Blest maiden, speak, thy wish declare.</q></l>
<l>The sweet-voiced nymph rejoiced to see</l>

<l>Most eloquent she thus began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thou hast, by heavenly grace sustained,</q></l>

<l>By force of holy penance won.</l>

<l><q rend="post">A son to me, thy suppliant, give.</q></l>
<l>The saint with favour heard her prayer,</l>

<l>Down from Himálaya's snowy height,</l>

<l>My sister's holy waves are hurled</l>

<l>Now rises, with his pure cold ray,</l>

<lg>
<l>The hours of night now waning fast</l>
<l>On Śona's pleasant shore they passed.</l>
<l>Then, when the dawn began to break,</l>
<l>To Ráma thus the hermit spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The light of dawn is breaking clear,</q></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma rose, and finished all</l>

<l>Prepared with joy the road to take,</l>
<l>And thus again in question spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Here fair and deep the Śona flows,</q></l>

<l>For many a league they journeyed on</l>

<l>Of Jáhnaví,<note place="foot">One of the names of the Ganges
considered as the daughter of Jahnu. See
Canto XLIV.</note> the Rivers' Queen.</l>
<l>Soon as the holy stream they viewed,</l>

<l>Of sárases<note place="foot">The Indian Crane.</note> and
swans,<note place="foot">Or, rather, geese.</note> delight</l>
<l>Possessed them at the lovely sight;</l>
<l>And then prepared the hermit band</l>
<l>To halt upon that holy strand.</l>
<l>They bathed as Scripture bids, and paid</l>
<l>Oblations due to God and shade.</l>
<l>To Fire they burnt the offerings meet,</l>
<l>And sipped the oil, like Amrit sweet.</l>
<l>Then pure and pleased they sate around</l>
<l>Saint Viśvámitra on the ground.</l>
<l>The holy men of lesser note,</l>
<l>In due degree, sate more remote,</l>
<l>While Raghu's sons took nearer place</l>
<l>By virtue of their rank and race.</l>
<l>Then Ráma said: <q rend="pre">O Saint, I yearn</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The three-pathed Gangá's tale to learn.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus urged, the sage recounted both</l>
<l>The birth of Gangá and her growth:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The mighty hill with metals stored,</q></l>
<l>Himálaya, is the mountains' lord,</l>
<l>The father of a lovely pair</l>
<l>Of daughters fairest of the fair:</l>
<l>Their mother, offspring of the will</l>
<l>Of Meru, everlasting hill,</l>
<l>Mená, Himálaya's darling, graced</l>
<l>With beauty of her dainty waist.</l>
<l>Gangá was elder-born: then came</l>
<l>The fair one known by Umá's name.</l>
<l>Then all the Gods of heaven, in need</l>
<l>Of Gangá's help their vows to speed,</l>
<l>To great Himálaya came and prayed</l>
<l>The mountain King to yield the maid.</l>
<l>He, not regardless of the weal</l>
<l>Of the three worlds, with holy zeal</l>
<l>His daughter to the Immortals gave,</l>
<l>Gangá whose waters cleanse and save,</l>
<l>Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,</l>
<l>Purging all sinners, to the sea.</l>
<l>The three-pathed Gangá thus obtained,</l>
<l>The Gods their heavenly homes regained.</l>
<l>Long time the sister Umá passed</l>
<l>In vows austere and rigid fast,</l>
<l>And the king gave the devotee</l>
<l>Immortal Rudra's<note place="foot">A name of the God Śiva.</note> bride to be,</l>
<l>Matching with that unequalled Lord</l>
<l>His Umá through the worlds adored.</l>
<l>So now a glorious station fills</l>
<l>Each daughter of the King of Hills:</l>
<l>One honoured as the noblest stream,</l>
<l>One mid the Goddesses supreme.</l>
<l>Thus Gangá, King Himálaya's child,</l>

<l>Rose bearing with her to the sky</l>
<l><q rend="post">Her waves that bless and purify.</q></l>

<head>Canto XXXIX. The Sons Of Sagar.</head>

<lg>
<l>The saint in accents sweet and clear</l>
<l>Thus told his tale for Ráma's ear,</l>
<l>And thus anew the holy man</l>
<l>A legend to the prince began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">There reigned a pious monarch o'er</q></l>
<l>Ayodhyá in the days of yore:</l>
<l>Sagar his name: no child had he,</l>
<l>And children much he longed to see.</l>
<l>His honoured consort, fair of face,</l>
<l>Sprang from Vidarbha's royal race,</l>
<l>Keśini, famed from early youth</l>
<l>For piety and love of truth.</l>
<l>Aríshṭanemi's daughter fair,</l>
<l>With whom no maiden might compare</l>
<l>In beauty, though the earth is wide,</l>
<l>Sumati, was his second bride.</l>
<l>With his two queens afar he went,</l>
<l>And weary days in penance spent,</l>
<l>Fervent, upon Himálaya's hill</l>
<l>Where springs the stream called Bhrigu' rill.</l>
<l>Nor did he fail that saint to please</l>
<l>With his devout austerities.</l>
<l>And, when a hundred years had fled,</l>
<l>Thus the most truthful Bhrigu said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">From thee, O Sagar, blameless King,</q></l>
<l>A mighty host of sons shall spring,</l>
<l>And thou shalt win a glorious name</l>
<l>Which none, O Chief, but thou shall claim.</l>
<l>One of thy queens a son shall bear,</l>
<l>Maintainer of thy race and heir;</l>
<l>And of the other there shall be</l>
<l><q rend="post">Sons sixty thousand born to thee.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus as he spake, with one accord,</l>
<l>To win the grace of that high lord,</l>
<l>The queens, with palms together laid,</l>
<l>In humble supplication prayed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Which queen, O Bráhman, of the pair,</q></l>
<l>The many, or the one shall bear?</l>
<l>Most eager, Lord, are we to know,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And as thou sayest be it so.</q></l>
<pb n="050"/><anchor id="Pg050"/>
<l>With his sweet speech the saint replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Yourselves, O Queens, the choice decide.</q></l>
<l>Your own discretion freely use</l>
<l>Which shall the one or many choose:</l>
<l>One shall the race and name uphold,</l>
<l>The host be famous, strong, and bold.</l>
<l><q rend="post">Which will have which?</q> Then Keśini</l>
<l>The mother of one heir would be.</l>
<l>Sumati, sister of the king<note place="foot">Garuḍa.</note></l>
<l>Of all the birds that ply the wing,</l>
<l>To that illustrious Bráhman sued</l>
<l>That she might bear the multitude</l>
<l>Whose fame throughout the world should sound</l>
<l>For mighty enterprise renowned.</l>
<l>Around the saint the monarch went,</l>
<l>Bowing his head, most reverent.</l>
<l>Then with his wives, with willing feet,</l>
<l>Resought his own imperial seat.</l>
<l>Time passed. The elder consort bare</l>
<l>A son called Asamanj, the heir.</l>
<l>Then Sumati, the younger, gave</l>
<l>Birth to a gourd,<note place="foot">Ikshváku, the name of a king of Ayodhyá
who is regarded as the founder of the
Solar race, means also a <hi rend='italic'>gourd</hi>. Hence,
perhaps, the myth.</note> O hero brave,</l>
<l>Whose rind, when burst and cleft in two,</l>
<l>Gave sixty thousand babes to view.</l>
<l>All these with care the nurses laid</l>
<l>In jars of oil; and there they stayed,</l>
<l>Till, youthful age and strength complete,</l>
<l>Forth speeding from each dark retreat,</l>
<l>All peers in valour, years, and might,</l>
<l>The sixty thousand came to light.</l>
<l>Prince Asamanj, brought up with care,</l>
<l>Scourge of his foes, was made the heir.</l>
<l>But liegemen's boys he used to cast</l>
<l>To Sarjú's waves that hurried past,</l>
<l>Laughing the while in cruel glee</l>
<l>Their dying agonies to see.</l>
<l>This wicked prince who aye withstood</l>
<l>The counsel of the wise and good,</l>
<l>Who plagued the people in his hate,</l>
<l>His father banished from the state.</l>
<l>His son, kind-spoken, brave, and tall,</l>
<l>Was Anśumán, beloved of all.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long years flew by. The king decreed</l>

<l>The best of floods, the rivers' queen,</l>
<l>Whose waters wash the wicked clean.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It chanced that Jahnu, great and good,</l>
<l>Engaged with holy offerings stood;</l>
<l>The river spread her waves around</l>
<l>Flooding his sacrificial ground.</l>
<l>The saint in anger marked her pride,</l>
<l>And at one draught her stream he dried.</l>
<l>Then God, and sage, and bard, afraid,</l>
<l>To noble high-souled Jahnu prayed,</l>
<l>And begged that he would kindly deem</l>
<l>His own dear child that holy stream.</l>
<l>Moved by their suit, he soothed their fears</l>
<l>And loosed her waters from his ears.</l>
<l>Hence Gangá through the world is styled</l>
<l>Both Jáhnavi and Jahnu's child.</l>
<l>Then onward still she followed fast,</l>
<l>And reached the great sea bank at last.</l>
<l>Thence deep below her way she made</l>
<l>To end those rites so long delayed.</l>
<l>The monarch reached the Ocean's side,</l>
<l>And still behind him Gangá hied.</l>
<l>He sought the depths which open lay</l>
<l>Where Sagar's sons had dug their way.</l>

<l>The river's purifying waves,</l>

<l>Over his kinsmen's dust the lord</l>

<l>And all in heavenly bodies dressed</l>
<l>Rose to the skies' eternal rest.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus to King Bhagírath said</l>
<l>Brahmá, when, coming at the head</l>

<l>Thy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.</l>
<l>The sons of Sagar mighty-souled,</l>
<l>Are with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,</l>
<l>Long as the Ocean's flood shall stand</l>
<l>Upon the border of the land,</l>
<l>So long shall Sagar's sons remain,</l>
<l>And, godlike, rank in heaven retain.</l>
<l>Gangá thine eldest child shall be,</l>
<l>Called from thy name Bhágirathí;</l>
<l>Named also—for her waters fell</l>
<l>From heaven and flow through earth and hell—</l>
<l>Tripathagá, stream of the skies,</l>
<l>Because three paths she glorifies.</l>
<l>And, mighty King, 'tis given thee now</l>
<l>To free thee and perform thy vow.</l>
<l>No longer, happy Prince, delay</l>
<l>Drink-offerings to thy kin to pay.</l>
<l>For this the holiest Sagar sighed,</l>
<l>But mourned the boon he sought denied.</l>
<l>Then Anśumán, dear Prince! although</l>
<l>No brighter name the world could show,</l>
<l>Strove long the heavenly flood to gain</l>
<l>To visit earth, but strove in vain.</l>
<l>Nor was she by the sages' peer,</l>
<l>Blest with all virtues, most austere,</l>
<l>Thy sire Dilípa, hither brought,</l>
<l>Though with fierce prayers the boon he sought.</l>
<l>But thou, O King, earned success,</l>
<l>And won high fame which God will bless.</l>
<l>Through thee, O victor of thy foes,</l>
<l>On earth this heavenly Gangá flows,</l>
<l>And thou hast gained the meed divine</l>
<l>That waits on virtue such as thine.</l>
<l>Now in her ever holy wave</l>
<l>Thyself, O best of heroes, lave:</l>
<l>So shalt thou, pure from every sin,</l>
<l>The blessed fruit of merit win.</l>
<l>Now for thy kin who died of yore</l>
<l>The meet libations duly pour.</l>
<l>Above the heavens I now ascend:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to the mighty king who broke</l>
<l>His foemens' might, Lord Brahmá spoke,</l>

<l>The royal sage no more delayed,</l>

<l>High and more high their wonder rose</l>
<l>As the strange story reached its close,</l>
<l>And thus, with Lakshmaṇ, Ráma, best</l>
<l>Of Raghu's sons, the saint addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Most wondrous is the tale which thou</q></l>
<l>Hast told of heavenly Gangá, how</l>
<l>From realms above descending she</l>
<l>Flowed through the land and filled the sea.</l>
<l>In thinking o'er what thou hast said</l>
<l>The night has like a moment fled,</l>

<l>Upon thy words most excellent:</l>
<l>So much, O holy Sage, thy lore</l>
<l><q rend="post">Has charmed us with this tale of yore.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Day dawned. The morning rites were done</l>
<l>And the victorious Raghu's son</l>
<l>Addressed the sage in words like these,</l>
<l>Rich in his long austerities:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The night is past: the morn is clear;</q></l>
<l>Told is the tale so good to hear:</l>
<l>Now o'er that river let us go,</l>
<l>Three-pathed, the best of all that flow.</l>

<l>Who of thy coming warned, in haste,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The barge upon the bank have placed.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Kuśik's son approved his speech,</l>
<l>And moving to the sandy beach,</l>
<l>Placed in the boat the hermit band,</l>
<l>And reached the river's further strand.</l>
<l>On the north bank their feet they set,</l>
<l>And greeted all the saints they met.</l>
<l>On Gangá's shore they lighted down,</l>
<l>And saw Viśálá's lovely town.</l>
<l>Thither, the princes by his side,</l>
<l>The best of holy hermits hied.</l>
<l>It was a town exceeding fair</l>
<pb n="057"/><anchor id="Pg057"/>
<l>That might with heaven itself compare.</l>
<l>Then, suppliant palm to palm applied,</l>
<l>Famed Ráma asked his holy guide:</l>

<l>Of monarchs rules this lovely place.</l>
<l>Dear master, let my prayer prevail,</l>
<l><q rend="post">For much I long to hear the tale.</q></l>
<l>Moved by his words, the saintly man</l>
<l>Viśálá's ancient tale began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">List, Ráma, list, with closest heed</q></l>
<l>The tale of Indra's wondrous deed,</l>
<l>And mark me as I truly tell</l>
<l>What here in ancient days befell.</l>
<l>Ere Krita's famous Age<note place="foot">The First or Golden Age.</note> had fled,</l>
<l>Strong were the sons of Diti<note place="foot">Diti and Aditi were wives of Kaśyap,
and mothers respectively of Titans and Gods.</note> bred;</l>
<l>And Aditi's brave children too</l>
<l>Were very mighty, good, and true.</l>
<l>The rival brothers fierce and bold</l>
<l>Were sons of Kaśyap lofty-souled.</l>
<l>Of sister mothers born, they vied,</l>
<l>Brood against brood, in jealous pride.</l>
<l>Once, as they say, band met with band,</l>
<l>And, joined in awful council, planned</l>
<l>To live, unharmed by age and time,</l>
<l>Immortal in their youthful prime.</l>
<l>Then this was, after due debate,</l>
<l>The counsel of the wise and great,</l>
<l>To churn with might the milky sea<note place="foot">One of the seven seas surrounding
as many worlds in concentric rings.</note></l>
<l>The life-bestowing drink to free.</l>
<l>This planned, they seized the Serpent King,</l>
<l>Vásuki, for their churning-string,</l>
<l>And Mandar's mountain for their pole,</l>
<l>And churned with all their heart and soul.</l>
<l>As thus, a thousand seasons through,</l>
<l>This way and that the snake they drew,</l>
<l>Biting the rocks, each tortured head,</l>
<l>A very deadly venom shed.</l>
<l>Thence, bursting like a mighty flame,</l>
<l>A pestilential poison came,</l>
<l>Consuming, as it onward ran,</l>
<l>The home of God, and fiend, and man.</l>
<l>Then all the suppliant Gods in fear</l>
<l>To Śankar,<note place="foot">Śankar and Rudra are names of Śiva.</note>
mighty lord, drew near.</l>
<l>To Rudra, King of Herds, dismayed,</l>
<l><q>Save us, O save us, Lord!</q> they prayed.</l>
<l>Then Vishṇu, bearing shell, and mace,</l>
<l>And discus, showed his radiant face,</l>
<l>And thus addressed in smiling glee</l>
<l>The Trident wielding deity:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What treasure first the Gods upturn</q></l>
<l>From troubled Ocean, as they churn,</l>
<l>Should—for thou art the eldest—be</l>
<l>Conferred, O best of Gods, on thee.</l>
<l>Then come, and for thy birthright's sake,</l>
<l><q rend="post">This venom as thy first fruits take.</q></l>
<l>He spoke, and vanished from their sight,</l>
<l>When Śiva saw their wild affright,</l>
<l>And heard his speech by whom is borne</l>
<l>The mighty bow of bending horn,<note place="foot"><q>Śárṅgin, literally
<hi rend='italic'>carrying a bow of
horn</hi>, is a constantly recurring name of
Vishṇu. The Indians also, therefore,
knew the art of making bows out of the
hons of antelopes or wild goats, which
Homer ascribes to the Trojans of the
heroic age.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Schlegel</hi>.</note></l>
<l>The poisoned flood at once he quaffed</l>
<l>As 'twere the Amrit's heavenly draught.</l>
<l>Then from the Gods departing went</l>
<l>Śiva, the Lord pre-eminent.</l>
<l>The host of Gods and Asurs still</l>
<l>Kept churning with one heart and will.</l>
<l>But Mandar's mountain, whirling round,</l>
<l>Pierced to the depths below the ground.</l>
<l>Then Gods and bards in terror flew</l>
<l>To him who mighty Madhu slew.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Help of all beings! more than all,</q></l>
<l>The Gods on thee for aid may call.</l>
<l>Ward off, O mighty-armed! our fate,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And bear up Mandar's threatening weight.</q></l>
<l>Then Vishṇu, as their need was sore,</l>
<l>The semblance of a tortoise wore,</l>
<l>And in the bed of Ocean lay</l>
<l>The mountain on his back to stay.</l>
<l>Then he, the soul pervading all,</l>
<l>Whose locks in radiant tresses fall,</l>
<l>One mighty arm extended still,</l>
<l>And grasped the summit of the hill.</l>
<l>So ranged among the Immortals, he</l>
<l>Joined in the churning of the sea.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">A thousand years had reached their close,</l>

<l>The gentle sage<note place="foot">Dhanvantari, the physician of the

<l>Lord of the art of healing man.</l>
<l>Then as the waters foamed and boiled,</l>

appears derogatory to the dignity of the

who ought rather to have been
made over to the Titans. However the
etymological fancy has prevailed. The

<l>Viśálá's ruler spoke at last:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">These princely youths, O Sage, who vie</q></l>
<l>In might with children of the sky,</l>
<l>Heroic, born for happy fate,</l>
<l>With elephants' or lions' gait,</l>
<l>Bold as the tiger or the bull,</l>
<l>With lotus eyes so large and full,</l>
<l>Armed with the quiver, sword, and bow,</l>

<l><q rend="post">The same fair form in each is seen,</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke; and at the monarch's call</l>
<l>The best of hermits told him all,</l>
<l>How in the grove with him they dwelt,</l>
<l>And slaughter to the demons dealt.</l>
<l>Then wonder filled the monarch's breast,</l>
<l>Who tended well each royal guest.</l>
<l>Thus entertained, the princely pair</l>
<l>Remained that night and rested there,</l>
<l>And with the morn's returning ray</l>
<l>To Mithilá pursued their way.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Janak's lovely city first</l>
<l>Upon their sight, yet distant, burst,</l>
<l>The hermits all with joyful cries</l>
<l>Hailed the fair town that met their eyes.</l>
<l>Then Ráma saw a holy wood,</l>
<l>Close, in the city's neighbourhood,</l>
<l>O'ergrown, deserted, marked by age,</l>
<l>And thus addressed the mighty sage:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O reverend lord. I long to know</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">What hermit dwelt here long ago.</q></l>
<l>Then to the prince his holy guide,</l>
<l>Most eloquent of men, replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Ráma, listen while I tell</q></l>
<l>Whose was this grove, and what befell</l>
<l>When in the fury of his rage</l>
<l>The high saint cursed the hermitage.</l>
<l>This was the grove—most lovely then—</l>
<l>Of Gautam, O thou best of men,</l>
<l>Like heaven itself, most honoured by</l>
<l>The Gods who dwell above the sky.</l>
<l>Here with Ahalyá at his side</l>
<l>His fervid task the ascetic plied.</l>
<l>Years fled in thousands. On a day</l>
<l>It chanced the saint had gone away,</l>
<l>When Town-destroying Indra came,</l>
<l>And saw the beauty of the dame.</l>
<l>The sage's form the God endued,</l>
<l>And thus the fair Ahalyá wooed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Love, sweet! should brook no dull delay</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">But snatch the moments when he may.</q></l>
<l>She knew him in the saint's disguise,</l>
<l>Lord Indra of the Thousand Eyes,</l>
<l>But touched by love's unholy fire,</l>
<l>She yielded to the God's desire.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q>Now, Lord of Gods!</q> she whispered,
<q rend="pre">flee,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">From Gautam save thyself and me.</q></l>
<l>Trembling with doubt and wild with dread</l>
<l>Lord Indra from the cottage fled;</l>
<l>But fleeing in the grove he met</l>
<l>The home-returning anchoret,</l>
<l>Whose wrath the Gods and fiends would shun,</l>
<l>Such power his fervent rites had won.</l>
<l>Fresh from the lustral flood he came,</l>
<l>In splendour like the burning flame,</l>
<l>With fuel for his sacred rites,</l>
<l>And grass, the best of eremites.</l>
<l>The Lord of Gods was sad of cheer</l>
<l>To see the mighty saint so near,</l>
<l>And when the holy hermit spied</l>
<l>In hermit's garb the Thousand-eyed,</l>
<pb n="061"/><anchor id="Pg061"/>
<l>He knew the whole, his fury broke</l>
<l>Forth on the sinner as he spoke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Because my form thou hast assumed,</q></l>
<l>And wrought this folly, thou art doomed,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No empty threat that sentence came,</l>

<l>His might and godlike vigour fled,</l>
<l>And every nerve was cold and dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then on his wife his fury burst,</l>
<l>And thus the guilty dame he cursed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">For countless years, disloyal spouse,</q></l>
<l>Devoted to severest vows,</l>
<l>Thy bed the ashes, air thy food,</l>
<l>Here shalt thou live in solitude.</l>

<l>And not an eye thy form shall see.</l>
<l>When Ráma, Daśaratha's child,</l>
<l>Shall seek these shades then drear and wild,</l>
<l>His coming shall remove thy stain,</l>
<l>And make the sinner pure again.</l>
<l>Due honour paid to him, thy guest,</l>

says: <q>In the same manner, if it is said that Indra was the seducer of
Ahalyá this does not imply that the God Indra committed such a crime, but Indra
means the sun, and Ahalyá (from ahan and lí) the night; and as the night is
seduced and ruined by the sun of the morning, therefore is Indra called the
paramour of Ahalyá.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Max Muller</hi>,

<lg>
<l>Then Ráma, following still his guide,</l>
<l>Within the grove, with Lakshmaṇ, hied,</l>
<l>Her vows a wondrous light had lent</l>
<l>To that illustrious penitent.</l>
<l>He saw the glorious lady, screened</l>
<l>From eye of man, and God, and fiend,</l>
<l>Like some bright portent which the care</l>
<l>Of Brahmá launches through the air,</l>
<l>Designed by his illusive art</l>
<l>To flash a moment and depart:</l>
<l>Or like the flame that leaps on high</l>
<l>To sink involved in smoke and die:</l>
<l>Or like the full moon shining through</l>
<l>The wintry mist, then lost to view:</l>
<l>Or like the sun's reflection, cast</l>
<l>Upon the flood, too bright to last:</l>
<l>So was the glorious dame till then</l>
<l>Removed from Gods' and mortals' ken,</l>
<l>Till—such was Gautam's high decree—</l>
<l>Prince Ráma came to set her free.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, with great joy that dame to meet,</l>
<l>The sons of Raghu clapped her feet;</l>
<l>And she, remembering Gautam's oath,</l>
<l>With gentle grace received them both;</l>
<l>Then water for their feet she gave,</l>
<l>Guest-gift, and all that strangers crave.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prince, of courteous rule aware,</l>
<l>Received, as meet, the lady's care.</l>
<l>Then flowers came down in copious rain,</l>
<l>And moving to the heavenly strain</l>
<l>Of music in the skies that rang,</l>
<l>The nymphs and minstrels danced and sang:</l>
<l>And all the Gods with one glad voice</l>
<l>Praised the great dame, and cried, <q rend="pre">Rejoice!</q></l>
<l>Through fervid rites no more defiled,</l>
<l><q rend="post">But with thy husband reconciled.</q></l>
<l>Gautam, the holy hermit knew—</l>
<l>For naught escaped his godlike view—</l>
<l>That Ráma lodged beneath that shade,</l>
<l>And hasting there his homage paid.</l>
<l>He took Ahalyá to his side,</l>
<l>From sin and folly purified,</l>
<l>And let his new-found consort bear</l>
<l>In his austerities a share.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma, pride of Raghu's race,</l>

<l>The sons of Raghu journeyed forth,</l>
<l>Bending their steps 'twixt east and north.</l>
<l>Soon, guided by the sage, they found,</l>
<l>Enclosed, a sacrificial ground.</l>
<l>Then to the best of saints, his guide,</l>

<l>Bearing the gift that greets the guest,</l>
<l>To meet him with all honour pressed.</l>
<l>The saint received with gladsome mind</l>

<lg>
<l>As Saint Vaśishṭha answered so,</l>
<l>Nor let the cow of plenty go,</l>
<l>The monarch, as a last resource,</l>
<l>Began to drag her off by force.</l>
<l>While the king's servants tore away</l>
<l>Their moaning, miserable prey,</l>
<l>Sad, sick at heart, and sore distressed,</l>
<l>She pondered thus within her breast:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Why am I thus forsaken? why</q></l>
<l>Betrayed by him of soul most high.</l>
<l>Vaśishṭha, ravished by the hands</l>
<l>Of soldiers of the monarch's bands?</l>
<l>Ah me! what evil have I done</l>
<l>Against the lofty-minded one,</l>
<l>That he, so pious, can expose</l>
<l><q rend="post">The innocent whose love he knows?</q></l>
<l>In her sad breast as thus she thought,</l>
<l>And heaved deep sighs with anguish fraught,</l>
<l>With wondrous speed away she fled,</l>
<l>And back to Saint Vaśishṭha sped.</l>
<l>She hurled by hundreds to the ground</l>
<l>The menial crew that hemmed her round,</l>
<l>And flying swifter than the blast</l>
<l>Before the saint herself she cast.</l>
<l>There Dapple-skin before the saint</l>
<l>Stood moaning forth her sad complaint,</l>
<l>And wept and lowed: such tones as come</l>
<l>From wandering cloud or distant drum.</l>
<l><q>O son of Brahmá,</q> thus cried she,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the Bráhman saint replied</l>
<l>To her whose heart with woe was tried,</l>
<l>And grieving for his favourite's sake,</l>

<l>Nor, duteous, hast thou failed in aught.</l>
<l>This king, o'erweening in the pride</l>

<l>Great, as a king whom regions dread.</l>

<l><q rend="post">So is he mightier far than I.</q></l>

<l>He spoke. Then she, in lowly mood,</l>
<l>To that high saint her speech renewed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">So judge not they who wisest are:</q></l>
<l>The Bráhman's might is mightier far.</l>
<l>For Bráhmans strength from Heaven derive,</l>
<l>And warriors bow when Bráhmans strive.</l>
<l>A boundless power 'tis thine to wield:</l>
<l>To such a king thou shouldst not yield,</l>
<l>Who, very mighty though he be,—</l>
<l>So fierce thy strength,—must bow to thee.</l>

<l>From finest pore and hair-cell, broke</l>
<l>Enveloped in a veil of smoke.</l>
<l>The staff he waved was all aglow</l>

how Triśanku, in asking the aid of Vaśishṭha's sons after
applying in vain to their father, could be charged with resorting to another
<hi rend='italic'>śákhá</hi> (School) in the ordinary sense of that
word; as it is not conceivable that the sons should have been of another Śákhá
from the father, whose cause they espouse with so much warmth. The commentator
in the Bombay edition explains the word <hi rend='italic'>Śákhantaram</hi> as
Yájanádiná rakshántaram, <q>one who by sacrificing for thee, etc., will be another
protector.</q> Gorresio's Gauḍa text, which may often be used as a
commentary on the older one, has the following paraphrase of the words in
question, ch. 60, 3. Múlam utsṛijya kasmát tvam sákhásv ichhasi lambitum. <q>Why,
forsaking the root, dost thou desire to hang upon the branches?</q></q>

<l><q>Thy wish is vain,</q> the saint replied,</l>

<l>O Monarch, of the childish heart,</l>

by Viśvámitra should be seven new southern stars, a sort of new Ursa. Von Schlegel
thinks that this mythical fiction of new stars created by Viśvámitra may signify
that these southern stars, unknown to the Indians as long as they remained in the
neighbourhood of the Ganges, became known to them at a later date when they
colonized the southern regions of India.</q>

Still his restless mind would not allow him to remain longer in the same spot.
So the character of Viśvámitra is ingeniously and skilfully shadowed forth: as he
had been formerly a most warlike king, loving battle and glory, bold, active,
sometimes unjust, and more frequently magnanimous, such also he always shows
himself in his character of anchorite and ascetic.</q>

young sons while Ambarísha was yet reigning being himself the son of Bhrigu and

<p><q>In the mythical story related in this and the following Canto we may discover,
I think, some indication of the epoch at which the immolation of lower animals

at Aulis, one legend tells us that a hind was substituted for the virgin.</q>

<head>Canto LXV. Visvámitra's Triumph</head>

<lg>
<l>Then from Himálaya's heights of snow,</l>
<l>The glorious saint prepared to go,</l>
<l>And dwelling in the distant east</l>
<l>His penance and his toil increased.</l>
<l>A thousand years his lips he held</l>
<l>Closed by a vow unparalleled,</l>
<l>And other marvels passing thought,</l>
<l>Unrivalled in the world, he wrought.</l>
<l>In all the thousand years his frame</l>
<l>Dry as a log of wood became.</l>
<l>By many a cross and check beset,</l>
<l>Rage had not stormed his bosom yet.</l>
<l>With iron will that naught could bend</l>
<l>He plied his labour till the end.</l>
<l>So when the weary years were o'er,</l>
<l>Freed from his vow so stern and sore,</l>
<l>The hermit, all his penance sped,</l>
<l>Sate down to eat his meal of bread.</l>
<l>Then Indra, clad in Bráhman guise,</l>
<l>Asked him for food with hungry eyes.</l>
<l>The mighty saint, with steadfast soul,</l>
<l>To the false Bráhman gave the whole,</l>
<l>And when no scrap for him remained,</l>
<l>Fasting and faint, from speech refrained.</l>
<l>His silent vow he would not break:</l>
<l>No breath he heaved, no word he spake,</l>
<l>Then as he checked his breath, behold!</l>
<l>Around his brow thick smoke-clouds rolled</l>
<l>And the three worlds, as if o'erspread</l>
<l>With ravening flames, were filled with dread.</l>
<l>Then God and saint and bard, convened,</l>
<l>And Nága lord, and snake, and fiend,</l>
<l>Thus to the General Father cried,</l>
<l>Distracted, sad, and terrified:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Against the hermit, sore assailed,</q></l>
<l>Lure, scathe, and scorn have naught availed,</l>
<l>Proof against rage and treacherous art</l>
<l>He keeps his vow with constant heart.</l>
<l>Now if his toils assist him naught</l>
<l>To gain the boon his soul has sought,</l>
<l>He through the worlds will ruin send</l>
<l>That fixt and moving things shall end,</l>
<l>The regions now are dark with doom,</l>
<l>No friendly ray relieves the gloom.</l>
<l>Each ocean foams with maddened tide,</l>
<l>The shrinking hills in fear subside.</l>
<l>Trembles the earth with feverous throe</l>
<l>The wind in fitful tempest blows.</l>
<l>No cure we see with troubled eyes:</l>
<l>And atheist brood on earth may rise.</l>
<l>The triple world is wild with care,</l>
<l>Or spiritless in dull despair.</l>
<l>Before that saint the sun is dim,</l>
<l>His blessed light eclipsed by him.</l>
<l>Now ere the saint resolve to bring</l>
<l>Destruction on each living thing,</l>
<l>Let us appease, while yet we may,</l>
<l>Him bright as fire, like fire to slay.</l>
<l>Yea, as the fiery flood of Fate</l>
<l>Lays all creation desolate,</l>
<l>He o'er the conquered Gods may reign:</l>
<l><q rend="post">O, grant him what he longs to gain.</q></l>
</lg>

<pb n="077"/><anchor id="Pg077"/>

<lg>
<l>Then all the Blest, by Brahmá led,</l>
<l>Approached the saint and sweetly said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Hail, Bráhman Saint! for such thy place:</q></l>
<l>Thy vows austere have won our grace.</l>
<l>A Bráhman's rank thy penance stern</l>
<l>And ceaseless labour richly earn.</l>
<l>I with the Gods of Storm decree</l>
<l>Long life, O Bráhman Saint, to thee.</l>
<l>May peace and joy thy soul possess:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Go where thou wilt in happiness.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by the General Sire addressed,</l>
<l>Joy and high triumph filled his breast.</l>
<l>His head in adoration bowed,</l>
<l>Thus spoke he to the Immortal crowd:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">If I, ye Gods, have gained at last</q></l>
<l>Both length of days and Bráhman caste,</l>
<l>Grant that the high mysterious name,</l>
<l>And holy Vedas, own my claim,</l>
<l>And that the formula to bless</l>
<l>The sacrifice, its lord confess.</l>
<l>And let Vaśishṭha, who excels</l>
<l>In Warriors' art and mystic spells,</l>
<l>In love of God without a peer,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Confirm the boon you promise here.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Brahmá's son Vaśishṭha, best</l>
<l>Of those who pray with voice repressed,</l>
<l>The Gods by earnest prayer prevailed,</l>
<l>And thus his new-made friend he hailed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thy title now is sure and good</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">To rights of saintly Bráhmanhood.</q></l>
<l>Thus spake the sage. The Gods, content,</l>
<l>Back to their heavenly mansions went.</l>
<l>And Viśvámitra, pious-souled,</l>
<l>Among the Bráhman saints enrolled,</l>
<l>On reverend Vaśishṭha pressed</l>
<l>The honours due to holy guest.</l>
<l>Successful in his high pursuit,</l>
<l>The sage, in penance resolute,</l>
<l>Walked in his pilgrim wanderings o'er</l>
<l>The whole broad land from shore to shore.</l>
<l>'Twas thus the saint, O Raghu's son,</l>
<l>His rank among the Bráhmans won.</l>
<l>Best of all hermits, Prince, is he;</l>
<l>In him incarnate Penance see.</l>
<l>Friend of the right, who shrinks from ill,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Heroic powers attend him still.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Bráhman, versed in ancient lore,</l>
<l>Thus closed his tale, and said no more,</l>
<l>To Śatánanda Kuśik's son</l>
<l>Cried in delight, Well done! well done!</l>
<l>Then Janak, at the tale amazed,</l>
<l>Spoke thus with suppliant hands upraised:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">High fate is mine, O Sage, I deem,</q></l>
<l>And thanks I owe for bliss supreme,</l>
<l>That thou and Raghu's children too</l>
<l>Have come my sacrifice to view.</l>
<l>To look on thee with blessed eyes</l>
<l>Exalts my soul and purifies.</l>
<l>Yea, thus to see thee face to face</l>
<l>Enriches me with store of grace.</l>
<l>Thy holy labours wrought of old,</l>
<l>And mighty penance, fully told,</l>
<l>Ráma and I with great delight</l>
<l>Have heard, O glorious Anchorite.</l>
<l>Unrivalled thine ascetic deeds:</l>
<l>Thy might, O Saint, all might exceeds.</l>
<l>No thought may scan, no limit bound</l>
<l>The virtues that in thee are found.</l>
<l>The story of thy wondrous fate</l>
<l>My thirsty ears can never sate.</l>
<l>The hour of evening rites is near:</l>
<l>The sun declines in swift career.</l>
<l>At early dawn, O Hermit, deign</l>
<l>To let me see thy face again.</l>
<l>Best of ascetics, part in bliss:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Do thou thy servant now dismiss.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The saint approved, and glad and kind</l>
<l>Dismissed the king with joyful mind</l>
<l>Around the sage King Janak went</l>
<l>With priests and kinsmen reverent.</l>
<l>Then Viśvámitra, honoured so,</l>
<l>By those high-minded, rose to go,</l>
<l>And with the princes took his way</l>
<l>To seek the lodging where they lay.</l>

<head>Canto LXVI. Janak's Speech.</head>

<lg>
<l>With cloudless lustre rose the sun;</l>
<l>The king, his morning worship done,</l>
<l>Ordered his heralds to invite</l>
<l>The princes and the anchorite.</l>
<l>With honour, as the laws decree,</l>
<l>The monarch entertained the three.</l>
<l>Then to the youths and saintly man</l>
<l>Videha's lord this speech began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O blameless Saint, most welcome thou!</q></l>
<l>If I may please thee tell me how.</l>
<l>Speak, mighty lord, whom all revere,</l>
<l><q rend="post">'Tis thine to order, mine to hear.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he on mighty thoughts intent;</l>
<l>Then thus the sage most eloquent:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">King Daśaratha's sons, this pair</q></l>
<l>Of warriors famous everywhere,</l>
<l>Are come that best of bows to see</l>
<l>That lies a treasure stored by thee.</l>
<l>This, mighty Janak, deign to show,</l>
<l>That they may look upon the bow,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And then, contented, homeward go.</q></l>
<l>Then royal Janak spoke in turn:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O best of Saints, the story learn</q></l>
<l>Why this famed bow, a noble prize,</l>
<l>A treasure in my palace lies.</l>
<l>A monarch, Devarát by name,</l>
<l>Who sixth from ancient Nimi came,</l>
<l>Held it as ruler of the land,</l>
<l>A pledge in his successive hand.</l>
<l>This bow the mighty Rudra bore</l>
<pb n="078"/><anchor id="Pg078"/>
<l>At Daksha's<note place="foot"><q>Daksha was one of the ancient Progenitors
or Prajápatis created by Brahmá. The sacrifice which is here spoken of and
in which Śankar or Śiva (called also here Rudra and Bhava) smote the Gods because
he had not been invited to share the sacred oblations with them, seems to refer to the
origin of the worship of Śiva, to its increase and to the struggle it maintained
with other older forms of worship.</q>
<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Gorresio</hi>.</note> sacrifice of yore,</l>
<l>When carnage of the Immortals stained</l>
<l>The rite that Daksha had ordained.</l>
<l>Then as the Gods sore wounded fled,</l>
<l>Victorious Rudra, mocking, said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Because, O Gods, ye gave me naught</q></l>
<l>When I my rightful portion sought,</l>
<l>Your dearest parts I will not spare,</l>
<l><q rend="post">But with my bow your frames will tear.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Sons of Heaven, in wild alarm,</l>
<l>Soft flatteries tried his rage to charm.</l>
<l>Then Bhava, Lord whom Gods adore,</l>
<l>Grew kind and friendly as before,</l>
<l>And every torn and mangled limb</l>
<l>Was safe and sound restored by him.</l>
<l>Thenceforth this bow, the gem of bows,</l>
<l>That freed the God of Gods from foes,</l>
<l>Stored by our great forefathers lay</l>
<l>A treasure and a pride for aye.</l>
<l>Once, as it chanced, I ploughed the ground,</l>
<l>When sudden, 'neath the share was found</l>
<l>An infant springing from the earth,</l>
<l>Named Sítá from her secret birth.<note place="foot"><p>Sítá means a furrow.</p>
<lg><l rend="margin-left: 6"><q rend="pre">Great Erectheus swayed,</q></l>

<p>Iliad, Book II.</p></note></l>
<l>In strength and grace the maiden grew,</l>
<l>My cherished daughter, fair to view.</l>
<l>I vowed her, of no mortal birth,</l>
<l>Meet prize for noblest hero's worth.</l>
<l>In strength and grace the maiden grew,</l>
<l>And many a monarch came to woo.</l>
<l>To all the princely suitors I</l>
<l>Gave, mighty Saint, the same reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I give not thus my daughter, she</q></l>
<l>Prize of heroic worth shall be.<note place="foot"><q>The whole story of Sítá, as will
be seen in the course of the poem has a great analogy with the ancient myth of
Proserpine.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Gorresio</hi>.</note></l>
<l>To Míthilá the suitors pressed</l>
<l>Their power and might to manifest.</l>
<l>To all who came with hearts aglow</l>
<l>I offered Śiva's wondrous bow.</l>
<l>Not one of all the royal band</l>
<l>Could raise or take the bow in hand.</l>
<l>The suitors' puny might I spurned,</l>
<l>And back the feeble princes turned.</l>
<l>Enraged thereat, the warriors met,</l>
<l>With force combined my town beset.</l>
<l>Stung to the heart with scorn and shame,</l>
<l>With war and threats they madly came,</l>
<l>Besieged my peaceful walls, and long</l>
<l>To Míthilá did grievous wrong.</l>
<l>There, wasting all, a year they lay,</l>
<l>And brought my treasures to decay,</l>
<l>Filling my soul, O Hermit chief,</l>
<l>With bitter woe and hopeless grief.</l>
<l>At last by long-wrought penance I</l>
<l>Won favour with the Gods on high,</l>
<l>Who with my labours well content</l>
<l>A four-fold host to aid me sent.</l>
<l>Then swift the baffled heroes fled</l>
<l>To all the winds discomfited—</l>
<l>Wrong-doers, with their lords and host,</l>
<l>And all their valour's idle boast.</l>
<l>This heavenly bow, exceeding bright,</l>
<l>These youths shall see, O Anchorite.</l>
<l>Then if young Ráma's hand can string</l>
<l>The bow that baffled lord and king,</l>
<l>To him I give, as I have sworn,</l>

<head>Canto LXVII. The Breaking Of The Bow.</head>

<lg>
<l>Then spoke again the great recluse:</l>
<l><q>This mighty bow, O King, produce.</q></l>
<l>King Janak, at the saint's request,</l>
<l>This order to his train addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Let the great bow be hither borne,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Which flowery wreaths and scents adorn.</q></l>
<l>Soon as the monarch's words were said,</l>
<l>His servants to the city sped,</l>
<l>Five thousand youths in number, all</l>
<l>Of manly strength and stature tall,</l>
<l>The ponderous eight-wheeled chest that held</l>
<l>The heavenly bow, with toil propelled.</l>
<l>At length they brought that iron chest,</l>
<l>And thus the godlike king addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This best of bows, O lord, we bring,</q></l>
<l>Respected by each chief and king,</l>
<l>And place it for these youths to see,</l>
<l><q rend="post">If, Sovereign, such thy pleasure be.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With suppliant palm to palm applied</l>
<l>King Janak to the strangers cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This gem of bows, O Bráhman Sage,</q></l>
<l>Our race has prized from age to age,</l>
<l>Too strong for those who yet have reigned,</l>
<l>Though great in might each nerve they strained.</l>
<pb n="079"/><anchor id="Pg079"/>
<l>Titan and fiend its strength defies,</l>
<l>God, spirit, minstrel of the skies.</l>
<l>And bard above and snake below</l>
<l>Are baffled by this glorious bow.</l>
<l>Then how may human prowess hope</l>
<l>With such a bow as this to cope?</l>
<l>What man with valour's choicest gift</l>
<l>This bow can draw, or string, or lift?</l>
<l>Yet let the princes, holy Seer,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Behold it: it is present here.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then spoke the hermit pious-souled:</l>
<l><q>Ráma, dear son, the bow behold.</q></l>
<l>Then Ráma at his word unclosed</l>
<l>The chest wherein its might reposed,</l>
<l>Thus crying, as he viewed it: <q rend="pre">Lo!</q></l>
<l>I lay mine hand upon the bow:</l>
<l>May happy luck my hope attend</l>
<l><q rend="post">Its heavenly strength to lift or bend.</q></l>
<l><q>Good luck be thine,</q> the hermit cried:</l>
<l><q>Assay the task!</q> the king replied.</l>
<l>Then Raghu's son, as if in sport,</l>
<l>Before the thousands of the court,</l>
<l>The weapon by the middle raised</l>
<l>That all the crowd in wonder gazed.</l>
<l>With steady arm the string he drew</l>
<l>Till burst the mighty bow in two.</l>
<l>As snapped the bow, an awful clang,</l>
<l>Loud as the shriek of tempests, rang.</l>
<l>The earth, affrighted, shook amain</l>
<l>As when a hill is rent in twain.</l>
<l>Then, senseless at the fearful sound,</l>
<l>The people fell upon the ground:</l>
<l>None save the king, the princely pair,</l>
<l>And the great saint, the shock could bear.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When woke to sense the stricken train,</l>
<l>And Janak's soul was calm again,</l>
<l>With suppliant hands and reverent head,</l>
<l>These words, most eloquent, he said:</l>

<l>A marvel has the hero wrought</l>
<l>Beyond belief, surpassing thought.</l>

<l>New glory on our line will shed:</l>
<l>And true my promise will remain</l>
<l>That hero's worth the bride should gain.</l>
<l>Dearer to me than light and life,</l>

<l>If thou, O Bráhman, leave concede,</l>

<l>This to the monarch shall they tell,</l>

<lg>
<l>Then with the morn's returning sun.</l>
<l>King Janak, when his rites were done,</l>
<l>Skilled all the charms of speech to know,</l>
<l>Spoke to wise Śatánanda so:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My brother, lord of glorious fame,</q></l>
<l>My younger, Kuśadhwaj by name,</l>
<l>Whose virtuous life has won renown,</l>
<l>Has settled in a lovely town,</l>
<l>Sánkáśyá, decked with grace divine,</l>
<l>Whose glories bright as Pushpak's shine,</l>
<l>While Ikshumatí rolls her wave</l>
<l>Her lofty rampart's foot to lave.</l>
<l>Him, holy priest, I long to see:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in the presence of the priest</l>
<l>The royal Janak spoke, and ceased.</l>
<l>Then came his henchmen, prompt and brave,</l>
<pb n="081"/><anchor id="Pg081"/>
<l>To whom his charge the monarch gave.</l>
<l>Soon as they heard his will, in haste</l>
<l>With fleetest steeds away they raced,</l>
<l>To lead with them that lord of kings,</l>
<l>As Indra's call Lord Vishṇu brings.</l>
<l>Sánkáśyá's walls they duly gained,</l>
<l>And audience of the king obtained.</l>
<l>To him they told the news they brought</l>
<l>Of marvels past and Janak's thought.</l>
<l>Soon as the king the story knew</l>
<l>From those good envoys swift and true,</l>
<l>To Janak's wish he gave assent,</l>
<l>And swift to Míthilá he went.</l>
<l>He paid to Janak reverence due,</l>
<l>And holy Śatánanda too,</l>
<l>Then sate him on a glorious seat</l>
<l>For kings or Gods celestial meet.</l>
<l>Soon as the brothers, noble pair</l>
<l>Peerless in might, were seated there,</l>
<l>They gave the wise Sudáman, best</l>
<l>Of councillors, their high behest:</l>
<l><q>Go, noble councillor,</q> they cried,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">And hither to our presence guide</q></l>
<l>Ikshváku's son, Ayodhyá's lord,</l>
<l>Invincible by foeman's sword,</l>
<l>With both his sons, each holy seer,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And every minister and peer.</q></l>
<l>Sudáman to the palace flew,</l>
<l>And saw the mighty king who threw</l>
<l>Splendour on Raghu's splendid race,</l>
<l>Then bowed his head with seemly grace:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O King, whose hand Ayodhyá sways,</q></l>
<l>My lord, whom Míthilá obeys,</l>
<l>Yearns with desire, if thou agree,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thee with thy guide and priest to see.</q></l>
<l>Soon as the councillor had ceased,</l>
<l>The king, with saint and peer and priest,</l>
<l>Sought, speeding through the palace gate,</l>
<l>The hall where Janak held his state.</l>
<l>There, with his nobles round him spread,</l>
<l>Thus to Videha's lord be said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thou knowest, King, whose aid divine</q></l>
<l>Protects Ikshváku's royal line.</l>
<l>In every need, whate'er befall,</l>
<l>The saint Vaśishṭha speaks for all.</l>
<l>If Viśvámitra so allow,</l>
<l>And all the saints around me now,</l>
<l>The sage will speak, at my desire,</l>
<l><q rend="post">As order and the truth require.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as the king his lips had stilled,</l>
<l>Up rose Vaśishṭha, speaker skilled.</l>
<l>And to Videha's lord began</l>
<l>In flowing words that holy man:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">From viewless Nature Brahmá rose,</q></l>
<l>No change, no end, no waste he knows.</l>
<l>A son had he Maríchi styled,</l>
<l>And Kaśyap was Maríchi's child.</l>
<l>From him Vivasvat sprang: from him</l>
<l>Manu whose fame shall ne'er be dim.</l>
<l>Manu, who life to mortals gave,</l>
<l>Begot Ikshváku good and brave.</l>
<l>First of Ayodhyá's kings was he,</l>
<l>Pride of her famous dynasty.</l>
<l>From him the glorious Kukshi sprang,</l>
<l>Whose fame through all the regions rang.</l>
<l>Rival of Kukshi's ancient fame,</l>
<l>His heir, the great Vikukshi, came,</l>
<l>His son was Váṇa, lord of might;</l>
<l>His Anaraṇya, strong to fight.</l>
<l>His son was Prithu, glorious name;</l>
<l>From him the good Triśanku came.</l>
<l>He left a son renowned afar,</l>
<l>Known by the name of Dhundhumár.</l>
<l>His son, who drove the mighty car,</l>
<l>Was Yuvanáśva, feared in war.</l>
<l>He passed away. Him followed then</l>
<l>His son Mándhátá, king of men.</l>
<l>His son was blest in high emprise,</l>
<l>Susandhi, fortunate and wise.</l>
<l>Two noble sons had he, to wit</l>
<l>Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit.</l>
<l>Bharat was Dhruvasandhi's son,</l>
<l>And glorious fame that monarch won.</l>
<l>The warrior Asit he begot.</l>
<l>Asit had warfare, fierce and hot,</l>
<l>With rival kings in many a spot,</l>
<l>Haihayas, Tálajanghas styled,</l>
<l>And Śaśivindus, strong and wild.</l>
<l>Long time he strove, but forced to yield</l>
<l>Fled from his kingdom and the field.</l>
<l>With his two wives away he fled</l>
<l>Where high Himálaya lifts his head,</l>
<l>And, all his wealth and glory past,</l>
<l>He paid the dues of Fate at last.</l>
<l>The wives he left had both conceived—</l>
<l>So is the ancient tale believed—</l>
<l>One, of her rival's hopes afraid</l>
<l>Fell poison in her viands laid.</l>
<l>It chanced that Chyavan, Bhrigu's child,</l>
<l>Had wandered to that pathless wild,</l>
<l>And there Himálaya's lovely height</l>
<l>Detained him with a strange delight.</l>
<l>There came the other widowed queen,</l>
<l>With lotus eyes and beauteous mien,</l>
<l>Longing a noble son to bear,</l>
<l>And wooed the saint with earnest prayer.</l>
<l>When thus Kálindi,<note place="foot">A different lady from the Goddess of
the Jumna who bears the same name.</note> fairest dame,</l>
<l>With reverent supplication came,</l>
<l>To her the holy sage replied:</l>

<l>An infant fortunate and strong.</l>
<l>Then weep no more, and check thy sighs,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Sweet lady of the lotus eyes.</q></l>
<l>The queen, who loved her perished lord,</l>
<l>For meet reply, the saint adored,</l>
<l>And, of her husband long bereaved,</l>
<l>She bore a son by him conceived.</l>
<l>Because her rival mixed the bane</l>

<l>Anśumán's son, Dilípa famed,</l>

<l>From him the great Kakutstha rose:</l>

<l>From him came Śankaṇ, and from him</l>
<l>Sudarśan, fair in face and limb.</l>
<l>From beautiful Sudarśan came</l>
<l>Prince Agnivarṇa, bright as flame.</l>
<l>His son was Śíghraga, for speed</l>
<l>Unmatched; and Maru was his seed.</l>
<l>Praśuśruka was Maru's child;</l>
<l>His son was Ambarísha styled.</l>
<l>Nahush was Ambarísha's heir,</l>

<l>Son of Nábhág was Aja: his,</l>
<l>The glorious Daśaratha is,</l>
<l>Whose noble children boast to be</l>

<l>Thus do those kings of purest race</l>

<l>Piles of parched rice some dishes bore,</l>

<l>Next chief of saints, Vaśishṭha came</l>

<l>The duties of thy life to share.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus as he spoke the monarch threw</l>

<l>The joyous cry, 'Tis well! 'Tis well!</l>
<l>His daughter Sítá thus bestowed,</l>
<l>O'er whom the sacred drops had flowed.</l>
<l>King Janak's heart with rapture glowed.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">King Janak's word the youths obeyed;</l>

called Paraśuráma, or Ráma with the axe, from the weapon which he
carried. He was while he lived the terror of the Warrior caste, and his name recalls
long and fierce struggles between the sacerdotal and military order in which
the latter suffered severely at the hands of their implacable enemy.</note></head>

<lg>
<l>Soon as the night had reached its close</l>
<l>The hermit Viśvámitra rose;</l>
<l>To both the kings he bade adieu</l>
<l>And to the northern hill withdrew.</l>
<l>Ayodhyá's lord of high renown</l>
<l>Received farewell, and sought his town.</l>
<l>Then as each daughter left her bower</l>
<l>King Janak gave a splendid dower,</l>
<l>Rugs, precious silks, a warrior force,</l>
<l>Cars, elephants, and foot, and horse,</l>
<l>Divine to see and well arrayed;</l>
<l>And many a skilful tiring-maid,</l>
<l>And many a young and trusty slave</l>
<l>The father of the ladies gave.</l>
<l>Silver and coral, gold and pearls</l>
<l>He gave to his beloved girls.</l>
<l>These precious gifts the king bestowed</l>
<l>And sped his guest upon his road.</l>
<l>The lord of Mithilá's sweet town</l>
<l>Rode to his court and lighted down.</l>
<l>Ayodhyá's monarch, glad and gay,</l>
<l>Led by the seers pursued his way</l>
<l>With his dear sons of lofty mind:</l>
<l>The royal army marched behind.</l>
<l>As on he fared the voice he heard</l>
<l>Around of many a dismal bird,</l>
<l>And every beast in wild affright</l>
<l>Began to hurry to the right.</l>
<l>The monarch to Vaśishṭha cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What strange misfortune will betide?</q></l>
<l>Why do the beasts in terror fly,</l>
<l>And birds of evil omen cry?</l>
<l>What is it shakes my heart with dread?</l>
<l><q rend="post">Why is my soul disquieted?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as he heard, the mighty saint</l>
<l>Thus answered Daśaratha's plaint</l>
<l>In sweetest tone: <q rend="pre">Now, Monarch, mark,</q></l>
<l>And learn from me the meaning dark.</l>
<l>The voices of the birds of air</l>
<l>Great peril to the host declare:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">As he and Daśaratha spoke</l>
<l>A tempest from the welkin broke,</l>
<l>That shook the spacious earth amain</l>

<l>The sun grew dark with murky cloud,</l>
<l>And o'er the skies was cast a shroud,</l>
<l>While o'er the army, faint with dread,</l>
<l>A veil of dust and ashes spread.</l>
<l>King, princes, saints their sense retained,</l>
<l>Fear-stupefied the rest remained.</l>
<l>At length, their wits returning, all</l>
<l>Beneath the gloom and ashy pall</l>
<l>Saw Jamadagni's son with dread,</l>
<l>His long hair twisted round his head,</l>
<l>Who, sprung from Bhrigu, loved to beat</l>
<l>The proudest kings beneath his feet.</l>
<l>Firm as Kailása's hill he showed,</l>
<l>Fierce as the fire of doom he glowed.</l>
<l>His axe upon his shoulder lay,</l>
<l>His bow was ready for the fray,</l>
<l>With thirsty arrows wont to fly</l>
<l>Like Lightnings from the angry sky.</l>
<l>A long keen arrow forth he drew,</l>
<l>Invincible like those which flew</l>
<l>From Śiva's ever-conquering bow</l>
<l>And Tripura in death laid low.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When his wild form, that struck with awe,</l>
<l>Fearful as ravening flame, they saw,</l>
<l>Vaśishṭha and the saints whose care</l>
<l>Was sacrifice and muttered prayer,</l>
<l>Drew close together, each to each,</l>
<l>And questioned thus with bated speech:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Indignant at his father's fate</q></l>
<l>Will he on warriors vent his hate,</l>
<l>The slayers of his father slay,</l>
<l>And sweep the loathed race away?</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with a gift the saints drew near</l>
<l>To Bhrigu's son whose look was fear,</l>
<l>And Ráma! Ráma! soft they cried.</l>

<l>The mighty Sire their wishes knew,</l>
<l>And he whose lips are ever true</l>
<l>Caused the two Gods to meet as foes.</l>
<l>Then fierce the rage of battle rose:</l>
<l>Bristled in dread each starting hair</l>
<l>As Śiva strove with Vishṇu there.</l>
<l>But Vishṇu raised his voice amain.</l>
<l>And Śiva's bowstring twanged in vain;</l>
<l>Its master of the Three bright Eyes</l>
<l>Stood fixt in fury and surprise.</l>
<l>Then all the dwellers in the sky,</l>
<l>Minstrel, and saint, and God drew nigh,</l>
<l>And prayed them that the strife might cease,</l>
<l>And the great rivals met in peace.</l>
<l>'Twas seen how Śiva's bow has failed</l>
<l>Unnerved, when Vishṇu's might assailed,</l>

<l>Gave it to Devarát the sage</l>

<l>The haughty challenge, undeterred</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Before this day have I been told</q></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He hastened then with graceful ease</l>

<l>So, son of Raghu, leave me still</l>

<l>Shall place me on Mahendra's height.</l>
<l>My mansions of eternal joy,</l>
<l>By penance won, thou mayst destroy,</l>
<l>My path to these thy shaft may stay.</l>
<l>Now to the work! No more delay!</l>
<l>I know thee Lord of Gods; I know</l>
<l>Thy changeless might laid Madhu low.</l>
<l>All other hands would surely fail</l>
<l>To bend this bow. All hail! all hail!</l>

<l>With whose achievements none compete,</l>
<l>Whose arm in war no God can meet.</l>
<l>No shame is mine, I ween, for thou,</l>

<head>Canto I. The Heir Apparent.</head>

<lg>
<l>So Bharat to his grandsire went</l>
<l>Obedient to the message sent,</l>
<l>And for his fond companion chose</l>
<l>Śatrughna slayer of his foes.<note place="foot">Śatrughna means slayer of foes, and
the word is repeated as an intensive epithet.</note></l>
<l>There Bharat for a time remained</l>
<l>With love and honour entertained,</l>
<l>King Aśvapati's constant care,</l>
<l>Beloved as a son and heir.</l>
<l>Yet ever, as they lived at ease,</l>
<l>While all around combined to please,</l>
<l>The aged sire they left behind</l>
<l>Was present to each hero's mind.</l>
<l>Nor could the king's fond memory stray</l>
<l>From his brave children far away,</l>
<l>Dear Bharat and Śatrughna dear,</l>
<l>Each Varuṇ's match or Indra's peer.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To all the princes, young and brave,</l>
<l>His soul with fond affection clave;</l>
<l>Around his loving heart they clung</l>
<l>Like arms from his own body sprung.<note place="foot">Alluding to the images of
Vishṇu, which have four arms, the four princes
being portions of the substance of that God.</note></l>
<l>But best and noblest of the four,</l>
<l>Good as the God whom all adore,</l>
<l>Lord of all virtues, undefiled,</l>
<l>His darling was his eldest child.</l>
<l>For he was beautiful and strong,</l>
<l>From envy free, the foe of wrong,</l>
<l>With all his father's virtues blest,</l>
<l>And peerless in the world confessed.</l>
<l>With placid soul he softly spoke:</l>
<l>No harsh reply could taunts provoke.</l>
<l>He ever loved the good and sage</l>
<l>Revered for virtue and for age,</l>
<l>And when his martial tasks were o'er</l>
<l>Sate listening to their peaceful lore.</l>
<l>Wise, modest, pure, he honoured eld,</l>
<l>His lips from lying tales withheld;</l>
<l>Due reverence to the Bráhmans gave,</l>
<l>And ruled each passion like a slave.</l>
<l>Most tender, prompt at duty's call,</l>
<l>Loved by all men he loved them all.</l>
<l>Proud of the duties of his race,</l>
<l>With spirit meet for Warrior's place.</l>
<l>He strove to win by glorious deed,</l>
<l>Throned with the Gods, a priceless meed.</l>
<l>With him in speech and quick reply</l>
<l>Vrihaspati might hardly vie,</l>
<l>But never would his accents flow</l>
<l>For evil or for empty show.</l>
<l>In art and science duly trained,</l>
<l>His student vow he well maintained;</l>
<l>He learnt the lore for princes fit,</l>
<l>The Vedas and their Holy Writ,</l>
<l>And with his well-drawn bow at last</l>
<l>His mighty father's fame surpassed.</l>
<l>Of birth exalted, truthful, just,</l>
<l>With vigorous hand, with noble trust,</l>
<l>Well taught by aged twice-born men</l>
<l>Who gain and right could clearly ken,</l>
<l>Full well the claims and bounds he knew</l>
<l>Of duty, gain, and pleasure too:</l>
<l>Of memory keen, of ready tact,</l>
<l>In civil business prompt to act.</l>
<l>Reserved, his features ne'er disclosed</l>
<l>What counsel in his heart reposed.</l>
<l>All idle rage and mirth controlled,</l>
<l>He knew the times to give and hold,</l>
<l>Firm in his faith, of steadfast will,</l>
<l>He sought no wrong, he spoke no ill:</l>
<l>Not rashly swift, not idly slow,</l>
<l>His faults and others' keen to know.</l>
<l>Each merit, by his subtle sense;</l>
<l>He matched with proper recompense.</l>
<l>He knew the means that wealth provide,</l>
<l>And with keen eye expense could guide.</l>
<l>Wild elephants could he reclaim,</l>
<l>And mettled steeds could mount and tame.</l>
<l>No arm like his the bow could wield,</l>
<l>Or drive the chariot to the field.</l>
<l>Skilled to attack, to deal the blow,</l>
<l>Or lead a host against the foe:</l>
<l>Yea, e'en infuriate Gods would fear</l>
<l>To meet his arm in full career.</l>
<l>As the great sun in noontide blaze</l>
<l>Is glorious with his world of rays,</l>
<l>So Ráma with these virtues shone</l>
<l>Which all men loved to gaze upon.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The aged monarch fain would rest,</l>
<l>And said within his weary breast,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Oh that I might, while living yet,</q></l>
<l>My Ráma o'er the kingdom set.</l>
<l>And see, before my course be run,</l>
<l>The hallowed drops anoint my son;</l>
<l>See all this spacious land obey,</l>
<l>From side to side, my first-born's sway,</l>
<l>And then, my life and joy complete,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Obtain in heaven a blissful seat!</q></l>
<l>In him the monarch saw combined</l>
<l>The fairest form, the noblest mind,</l>
<l>And counselled how his son might share,</l>
<l>The throne with him as Regent Heir.</l>
<l>For fearful signs in earth and sky,</l>
<l>And weakness warned him death was nigh:</l>
<l>But Ráma to the world endeared</l>
<l>By every grace his bosom cheered,</l>
<pb n="090"/><anchor id="Pg090"/>
<l>The moon of every eye, whose ray</l>
<l>Drove all his grief and fear away.</l>
<l>So duty urged that hour to seize,</l>
<l>Himself, his realm, to bless and please.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From town and country, far and near,</l>
<l>He summoned people, prince, and peer.</l>
<l>To each he gave a meet abode,</l>
<l>And honoured all and gifts bestowed.</l>
<l>Then, splendid in his king's attire,</l>
<l>He viewed them, as the general Sire,</l>
<l>In glory of a God arrayed,</l>
<l>Looks on the creatures he has made.</l>
<l>But Kekaya's king he called not then</l>
<l>For haste, nor Janak, lord of men;</l>
<l>For after to each royal friend</l>
<l>The joyful tidings he would send.</l>
<l>Mid crowds from distant countries met</l>
<l>The king upon his throne was set;</l>
<l>Then honoured by the people, all</l>
<l>The rulers thronged into the hall.</l>
<l>On thrones assigned, each king in place</l>
<l>Looked silent on the monarch's face.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then girt by lords of high renown</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And throngs from hamlet and from town</l>

<head>Canto II. The People's Speech.</head>

<lg>
<l>Then to the full assembly bowed</l>
<l>The monarch, and addressed the crowd</l>
<l>With gracious speech, in accents loud</l>
<l>As heavenly drum or thunder-cloud:</l>
</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Needs not to you who know declare</q></l>
<l>How ever with paternal care</l>
<l>My fathers of Ikshváku's line</l>

<l>I too have taught my feet to tread</l>
<l>The pathway of the mighty dead,</l>
<l>And with fond care that never slept</l>
<l>Have, as I could, my people kept.</l>
<l>So toiling still, and ne'er remiss</l>
<l>For all my people's weal and bliss,</l>
<l>Beneath the white umbrella's<note place="foot">Chief of the insignia of imperial
dignity.</note> shade.</l>
<l>Old age is come and strength decayed.</l>
<l>Thousands of years have o'er me flown,</l>
<l>And generations round me grown</l>
<l>And passed away. I crave at length</l>
<l>Repose and ease for broken strength.</l>
<l>Feeble and worn I scarce can bear</l>
<l>The ruler's toil, the judge's care,</l>
<l>With royal dignity, a weight</l>
<l>That tries the young and temperate.</l>
<l>I long to rest, my labour done,</l>
<l>And in my place to set my son,</l>
<l>If to the twice-born gathered here</l>
<l>My counsel wise and good appear.</l>
<l>For greater gifts than mine adorn</l>
<l>Ráma my son, my eldest-born.</l>
<l>Like Indra brave, before him fall</l>
<l>The foeman's cities, tower and wall.</l>
<l>Him prince of men for power and might,</l>
<l>The best maintainer of the right,</l>
<l>Fair as the moon when nothing bars</l>
<l>His glory close to Pushya's stars,</l>
<l>Him with to-morrow's light I fain</l>
<l>Would throne the consort of my reign.</l>
<l>A worthy lord for you, I ween,</l>
<l>Marked as her own by Fortune's Queen.</l>
<l>The triple world itself would be</l>
<l>Well ruled by such a king as he.</l>
<l>To such high bliss and happy fate</l>
<l>Will I the country dedicate,</l>
<l>And my sad heart will cease to grieve</l>
<l>If he the precious charge receive.</l>
<l>Thus is my careful plan matured,</l>
<l>Thus for myself is rest secured;</l>
<l>Lieges, approve the words I say,</l>
<l>Or point ye out some wiser way.</l>
<l>Devise your prudent plan. My mind</l>
<l>Is fondly to this thought inclined,</l>
<l>But men by keen debating move</l>
<l><q rend="post">Some middle course which all approve.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch ceased. In answer came</l>
<l>The joyous princes' glad acclaim.</l>
<l>So peacocks in the rain rejoice</l>
<l>And hail the cloud with lifted voice.</l>
<l>Murmurs of joy from thousands round</l>
<l>Shook the high palace with the sound.</l>
<l>Then when the gathered throng had learned</l>
<l>His will who right and gain discerned,</l>
<l>Peasant and townsman, priest and chief,</l>
<l>All met in consultation brief,</l>
<l>And soon agreed with one accord</l>
<l>Gave answer to their sovereign lord:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">King of the land, we know thee old:</q></l>
<l>Thousands of years have o'er thee rolled,</l>
<l>Ráma thy son, we pray, anoint,</l>
<l>And at thy side his place appoint</l>
<l>Our gallant prince, so brave and strong,</l>
<l>Riding in royal state along,</l>
<l>Our eyes with joyful pride will see</l>
<l><q rend="post">Screened by the shade that shelters thee.</q></l>
<l>Then spake the king again, as though</l>
<l>Their hearts' true wish he sought to know:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">These prayers for Ráma's rule suggest</q></l>
<l>One question to my doubting breast.</l>
<l>This thing, I pray, with truth explain:</l>
<l>Why would ye, while I justly reign,</l>
<l>That he, mine eldest son, should bear</l>
<l><q rend="post">His part with me as ruling heir?</q></l>
<l>Then all the people made reply,</l>
<l>Peasant and townsman, low and high:</l>

<pb n="091"/><anchor id="Pg091"/>
<l>O Monarch, in thy son we find.</l>
<l>Do thou the godlike virtues hear</l>
<l>Which Ráma to our hearts endear.</l>
<l>So richly blest with graces, none</l>
<l>In all the earth excels thy son:</l>
<l>Nay, who to match with him may claim</l>
<l>In truth, in justice, and in fame?</l>
<l>True to his promise, gentle, kind,</l>
<l>Unenvious, of grateful mind,</l>
<l>Versed in the law and firm of soul,</l>
<l>He keeps each sense with strict control.</l>
<l>With duteous care he loves to sit</l>
<l>By Bráhmans skilled in Holy Writ.</l>
<l>Hence brightest glory, ne'er to end,</l>
<l>And matchless fame his youth attend.</l>
<l>Skilled in the use of spear and shield,</l>
<l>And arms which heavenly warriors wield,</l>
<l>Supreme in war, unconquered yet</l>
<l>By man, fiend, God in battle met,</l>
<l>Whene'er in pomp of war he goes</l>
<l>'Gainst town or city of the foes,</l>
<l>He ever comes with Lakshmaṇ back</l>
<l>Victorious from the fierce attack.</l>
<l>Returning homeward from afar</l>
<l>Borne on his elephant or car,</l>
<l>He ever to the townsmen bends</l>
<l>And greets them as beloved friends,</l>
<l>Asks how each son, each servant thrives,</l>
<l>How fare our pupils, offerings, wives;</l>
<l>And like a father bids us tell,</l>
<l>Each for himself, that all is well.</l>
<l>If pain or grief the city tries</l>
<l>His heart is swift to sympathize.</l>
<l>When festive scenes our thoughts employ</l>
<l>He like a father shares the joy.</l>
<l>High is the fate, O King, that gave</l>
<l>Thy Ráma born to bless and save,</l>
<l>With filial virtues fair and mild</l>
<l>Like Kaśyap old Maríchi's child.</l>
<l>Hence to the kingdom's distant ends</l>
<l>One general prayer for him ascends.</l>
<l>Each man in town and country prays</l>
<l>For Ráma's strength, health, length of days.</l>
<l>With hearts sincere, their wish the same,</l>
<l>The tender girl, the aged dame,</l>
<l>Subject and stranger, peasant, hind,</l>
<l>One thought impressed on every mind,</l>
<l>At evening and at dawning day</l>
<l>To all the Gods for Ráma pray.</l>
<l>Do thou, O King, of grace comply,</l>

<l>The monarch with the prayer complied</l>

<l>And then these gracious words he said:</l>

<head>Canto IV. Ráma Summoned.</head>

<lg>
<l>The crowd dismissed, to high debate</l>
<l>The monarch called his peers of state,</l>
<l>And, counsel from their lips obtained,</l>
<l>Firm in his will his will explained:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">To-morrow with auspicious ray</q></l>
<l>The moon in Pushya's sign will stay;</l>
<l>Be that the time with happy fate</l>
<l>Mine eldest son to consecrate,</l>
<l>And let my Ráma, lotus-eyed,</l>
<l><q rend="post">As Regent o'er the state preside.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sought, within, his charioteer,</l>
<l>And cried <q>Again bring Ráma here.</q></l>
<l>To Ráma's home Sumantra hied</l>
<l>Again to be the prince's guide.</l>
<l>His coming, told to Ráma's ear,</l>
<l>Suggested anxious doubt and fear.</l>
<l>He bade the messenger be led</l>
<l>That instant in, and thus he said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Tell me the cause, omitting naught,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Why thou again my house hast sought.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The envoy answered: <q rend="pre">Prince, thy sire</q></l>
<l>Has sent thy presence to require.</l>
<l>My sender known, 'tis thine to say</l>
<l><q rend="post">If thou wilt go or answer nay.</q></l>
<l>Then Ráma, when he heard his speech,</l>
<l>Made haste the royal court to reach.</l>
<l>Soon as the monarch was aware</l>
<l>His dearest son was waiting there,</l>
<l>Eager the parley to begin</l>
<l>He bade them lead the prince within,</l>
<l>Soon as he passed the chamber door</l>
<l>The hero bent him to the floor,</l>
<l>And at a distance from his seat</l>
<l>Raised his joined hands his sire to greet.</l>
<l>The monarch raised him from the ground,</l>
<l>And loving arms about him wound,</l>
<l>Then pointed to a seat that shone</l>
<l>With gold for him to rest upon.</l>
<l><q>Aged am I,</q> he said, <q rend="pre">and worn;</q></l>
<l>In life's best joys my share have borne;</l>
<l>Rites to the Gods, in hundreds, paid,</l>
<l>With gifts of corn and largess made.</l>
<l>I yearned for sons: my life is blest</l>
<l>With them and thee of sons the best.</l>
<l>No debt to saints or Bráhmans, no,</l>
<l>Nor spirits, Gods, or self I owe.</l>
<l>One duty now remains alone,</l>
<l>To set thee on thy father's throne.</l>
<l>Now therefore, Ráma, hear my rede,</l>
<l>And mark my words with duteous heed:</l>
<l>This day the peoples' general voice,</l>
<l>Elects thee king of love and choice,</l>
<l>And I, consenting to the prayer,</l>
<l>Will make thee, darling, Regent Heir.</l>
<l>Dread visions, each returning night,</l>
<l>With evil omens scare my sight.</l>
<l>Red meteors with a fearful sound</l>
<l>Shoot wildly downward to the ground,</l>
<l>While tempests lash the troubled air;</l>
<l>And they who read the stars declare</l>
<l>That, leagued against my natal sign,</l>
<l>Ráhu,<note place="foot">Ráhu, the ascending node, is in mythology
a demon with the tail of a dragon whose head was severed from his body

and being transferred to the stellar sphere became the authors of eclipses; the first
especially by endeavouring to swallow the sun and moon.</note>
the Sun,<note place="foot">In eclipse.</note> and Mars combine.</l>
<l>When portents dire as these appear,</l>
<l>A monarch's death or woe is near.</l>
<l>Then while my senses yet are spared,</l>
<l>And thought and will are unimpaired,</l>
<l>Be thou, my son, anointed king:</l>
<l>Men's fancy is a fickle thing.</l>
<l>To-day the moon, in order due,</l>
<l>Entered the sign Punarvasu,<note place="foot">The seventh of the lunar
asterisms.</note></l>
<l>To-morrow, as the wise foretell,</l>
<l>In Pushya's favouring stars will dwell:</l>
<l>Then on the throne shalt thou be placed.</l>
<l>My soul, prophetic, counsels haste:</l>
<l>Thee, O my son, to-morrow I</l>
<l>As Regent Heir will sanctify.</l>
<l>So till the coming night be passed</l>
<l>Do thou and Sítá strictly fast:</l>
<l>From worldly thoughts thy soul refrain,</l>
<l>And couched on holy grass remain.</l>
<pb n="094"/><anchor id="Pg094"/>
<l>And let thy trusted lords attend</l>
<l>In careful watch upon their friend,</l>
<l>For, unexpected, check and bar</l>
<l>Our weightiest counsels often mar.</l>
<l>While Bharat too is far away</l>
<l>Making with royal kin his stay,</l>
<l>I deem the fittest time of all</l>
<l>Thee, chosen Regent, to install.</l>
<l>It may be Bharat still has stood</l>
<l>True to the counsels of the good,</l>
<l>Faithful to thee with tender trust,</l>
<l>With governed senses, pure and just.</l>
<l>But human minds, too well I know,</l>
<l>Will sudden changes undergo,</l>
<l>And by their constant deeds alone</l>
<l>The virtue of the good is shown.</l>
<l>Now, Ráma, go. My son, good night!</l>
<l><q rend="post">Fixt is to-morrow for the rite.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma paid the reverence due,</l>
<l>And quickly to his home withdrew.</l>
<l>He passed within, nor lingered there,</l>
<l>But sought his mother's mansion, where</l>
<l>The dame in linen robes arrayed</l>
<l>Devoutly in the chapel prayed</l>
<l>To Fortune's Queen, with utterance checked,</l>
<l>That she her Ráma would protect.</l>
<l>There was Sumitrá too, and there</l>
<l>Was Lakshmaṇ led by loving care:</l>
<l>And when the royal choice they knew</l>
<l>Sítá in haste was summoned too.</l>
<l>Absorbed, with half-shut eyes, the queen</l>
<l>Attended by the three was seen.</l>
<l>She knew that Pushya's lucky hour</l>
<l>Would raise her son to royal power,</l>
<l>So fixed with bated breath each thought</l>
<l>On God supreme, by all men sought.</l>
<l>To her, as thus she knelt and prayed,</l>
<l>Ráma drew near, due reverence paid,</l>
<l>And then to swell his mother's joy,</l>
<l>Thus spoke her own beloved boy;</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O mother dear, my sire's decree</q></l>
<l>Entrusts the people's weal to me.</l>
<l>To-morrow I, for so his will,</l>
<l>Anointed king, the throne shall fill.</l>
<l>The few last hours till night shall end</l>
<l>Sítá with me must fasting spend,</l>
<l>For so my father has decreed,</l>
<l>And holy priests with him agreed.</l>
<l>What vows soever thou mayst deem</l>
<l>My consecration's eve beseem,</l>
<l>Do thou, sweet mother, for my sake</l>
<l><q rend="post">And for beloved Sítá's make.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the glad news Kauśalyá heard,</l>
<l>So long desired, so long deferred,</l>
<l>While tears of joy her utterance broke,</l>
<l>In answer to her son she spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Long be thy life, my darling: now</q></l>
<l>Thy prostrate foes before thee bow.</l>
<l>Live long and with thy bright success</l>
<l>My friends and dear Sumitrá's bless.</l>
<l>Surely the stars were wondrous fair</l>
<l>When thee, sweet son, thy mother bare,</l>
<l>That thy good gifts such love inspire</l>
<l>And win the favour of thy sire.</l>
<l>With thee I travailed not in vain;</l>
<l>Those lotus eyes reward my pain,</l>
<l>And all the glory of the line</l>
<l><q rend="post">Of old Ikshváku will be thine.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He smiled, and on his brother gazed</l>
<l>Who sate with reverent hands upraised,</l>
<l>And said: <q rend="pre">My brother, thou must be</q></l>
<l>Joint-ruler of this land with me.</l>
<l>My second self thou, Lakshmaṇ, art,</l>
<l>And in my fortune bearest part.</l>
<l>Be thine, Sumitrá's son, to know</l>
<l>The joys from regal power that flow.</l>
<l>My life itself, the monarch's seat,</l>
<l><q rend="post">For thy dear sake to me are sweet.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma to his brother said,</l>
<l>To both his mothers<note place="foot">Kauśalyá and Sumitrá.</note> bowed his head,</l>

<lg>
<l>Then Saint Vaśishṭha to the king</l>
<l>Came ready at his summoning.</l>
<l><q>Now go,</q> exclaimed the monarch, <q rend="pre">thou</q></l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The best of those who Scripture know</l>
<l>Said to the king, <q>My lord, I go.</q></l>
<l>To Ráma's house Vaśishṭha hied,</l>
<l>The hero's fast by rule to guide,</l>
<l>And skilled in sacred texts to tell</l>
<l>Each step to him instructed well.</l>
<l>Straight to Prince Ráma's high abode,</l>
<l>That like a cloud pale-tinted showed,</l>
<l>Borne in his priestly car he rode.</l>
<l>Two courts he passed, and in the third</l>
<l>He stayed his car. Then Ráma heard</l>
<l>The holy sage was come, and flew</l>
<l>To honour him with honour due.</l>
<l>He hastened to the car and lent</l>
<l>His hand to aid the priest's descent.</l>
<l>Then spoke Vaśishṭha words like these,</l>
<l>Pleased with his reverent courtesies,</l>
<l>With pleasant things his heart to cheer</l>
<l>Who best deserved glad news to hear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Prince, thou hast won thy father's grace,</q></l>
<l>And thine will be the Regent's place:</l>
<l>Now with thy Sítá, as is right,</l>
<l>In strictest fasting spend the night,</l>
<pb n="095"/><anchor id="Pg095"/>
<l>For when the morrow's dawn is fair</l>

<l><q rend="post">Yayáti joyed to consecrate.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having said, Vaśishṭha next</l>
<l>Ordained the fast by rule and text,</l>
<l>For Ráma faithful to his vows</l>
<l>And the Videhan dame his spouse.</l>
<l>Then from the prince's house he hied</l>
<l>With courteous honours gratified.</l>
<l>Round Ráma gathered every friend</l>
<l>In pleasant talk a while to spend.</l>
<l>He bade good night to all at last,</l>
<l>And to his inner chamber passed.</l>
<l>Then Ráma's house shone bright and gay</l>
<l>With men and maids in glad array,</l>
<l>As in the morning some fair lake</l>
<l>When all her lotuses awake,</l>
<l>And every bird that loves the flood</l>
<l>Flits joyous round each opening bud.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth from the house Vaśishṭha drove,</l>
<l>That with the king's in splendour strove,</l>
<l>And all the royal street he viewed</l>
<l>Filled with a mighty multitude</l>
<l>The eager concourse blocked each square,</l>
<l>Each road and lane and thoroughfare,</l>
<l>And joyous shouts on every side</l>
<l>Rose like the roar of Ocean's tide,</l>
<l>As streams of men together came</l>
<l>With loud huzza and glad acclaim.</l>
<l>The ways were watered, swept and clean,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The priest advancing slowly through</l>
<l>The mighty crowd he cleft in two,</l>
<l>Near to the monarch's palace drew.</l>
<l>He sought the terrace, by the stair,</l>
<l>Like a white cloud-peak high in air,</l>
<l>The reverend king of men to meet</l>
<l>Who sate upon his splendid seat:</l>
<l>Thus will Vṛihaspati arise</l>

<l>But when the king his coming knew,</l>

<l>Vaśishṭha, rose as rose the king.</l>
<l>Vaśishṭha bade his lord adieu,</l>

<lg>
<l>Then Ráma bathed in order due,</l>
<l>His mind from worldly thoughts withdrew,</l>
<l>And with his large-eyed wife besought</l>
<l>Náráyaṇ, as a votary ought.</l>
<l>Upon his head the brimming cup</l>
<l>Of holy oil he lifted up,</l>
<l>Then placed within the kindled fire</l>
<l>The offering to that heavenly Sire,</l>
<l>And as he sipped the remnant prayed</l>
<l>To Him for blessing and for aid.</l>
<l>Then with still lips and tranquil mind</l>
<l>With his Videhan he reclined,</l>
<l>In Vishṇu's chapel, on a bed</l>
<l>Where holy grass was duly spread,</l>
<l>While still the prince's every thought</l>
<l>The God supreme, Náráyaṇ, sought.</l>
<l>One watch remained the night to close</l>
<l>When Ráma from his couch arose,</l>
<l>And bade the men and maids adorn</l>
<l>His palace for the solemn morn.</l>
<l>He heard the bards and heralds raise</l>
<l>Auspicious strains of joy and praise;</l>
<l>And breathed devout, with voice restrained,</l>
<l>The hymn for morning rites ordained;</l>
<l>Then, with his head in reverence bowed,</l>
<l>Praised Madhu's conquering foe aloud,</l>
<l>And, in pure linen robes arrayed,</l>
<l>The priests to raise their voices prayed.</l>
<l>Obedient to the summons they</l>
<l>Proclaimed to all the festal day.</l>
<l>The Bráhmans' voices, deep and sweet,</l>
<l>Resounded through the crowded street,</l>

<l>In preparation for the rite.</l>
<l>Swiftly the joyful tidings through</l>

<l>Here players shone in bright attire,</l>
<l>There dancing women swelled the quire.</l>
<l>Each with his friend had much to say</l>
<l>Of Ráma's consecration-day:</l>
<l>Yea, even children, as they played</l>
<l>At cottage doors beneath the shade.</l>
<l>The royal street with flowers was strown</l>
<l>Which loving hands in heaps had thrown,</l>

<l>With careful foresight to illume</l>

<l>The people of the town who longed</l>

<l>For idle dreams of fancied bliss?</l>
<l>Hast thou not sense thy state to know,</l>

<l>Sick as I am with grief and pain</l>
<l>My lips can scarce a laugh restrain</l>

<l>A peril mighty to destroy.</l>

<l>The lordship of a rival's son,</l>
<l>Rejoiced to find her secret foe</l>

<l>That might the younger two advance.</l>
<l>Yes, Queen, 'tis Ráma that I dread,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus the maid in wrath complained,</l>

<l>And answered eager in defence</l>
<l>Of Ráma's worth and excellence:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Nay, Ráma, born the monarch's heir,</q></l>

<l>Claims royal sway as rightly due.</l>
<l>He, like a sire, will long defend</l>
<l>Each brother, minister, and friend.</l>
<l>Then why, O hump-back, art thou pained</l>
<l>To hear that he the throne has gained?</l>
<l>Be sure when Ráma's empire ends,</l>
<l>The kingdom to my son descends,</l>
<l>Who, when a hundred years are flown,</l>
<l>Shall sit upon his fathers' throne.</l>
<l>Why is thine heart thus sad to see</l>

<l>This fortune by possession sure</l>
<l>And hopes which we may count secure?</l>
<l>Dear as the darling son I bore</l>
<l>Is Ráma, yea, or even more.</l>
<l>Most duteous to Kauśalyá, he</l>
<l>Is yet more dutiful to me.</l>
<l>What though he rule, we need not fear:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She ceased. The troubled damsel sighed</l>
<l>Sighs long and hot, and thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What madness has possessed thy mind,</q></l>
<l>To warnings deaf, to dangers blind?</l>
<l>Canst thou not see the floods of woe</l>
<l>That threaten o'er thine head to flow:</l>
<l>First Ráma will the throne acquire,</l>
<l>Then Ráma's son succeed his sire,</l>
<l>While Bharat will neglected pine</l>
<l>Excluded from the royal line.</l>
<l>Not all his sons, O lady fair,</l>
<l>The kingdom of a monarch share:</l>
<l>All ruling when a sovereign dies</l>
<l>Wild tumult in the state would rise.</l>
<l>The eldest, be he good or ill,</l>
<l>Is ruler by the father's will.</l>
<l>Know, tender mother, that thy son</l>
<l>Without a friend and all undone,</l>
<l>Far from the joyous ease of home</l>
<l>An alien from his race will roam.</l>
<l>I sped to thee for whom I feel,</l>
<l>But thy fond heart mistakes my zeal,</l>
<l>Thy hand a present would bestow</l>
<l>Because thy rival triumphs so.</l>
<l>When Ráma once begins his sway</l>
<l>Without a foe his will to stay,</l>
<l>Thy darling Bharat he will drive</l>
<l>To distant lands if left alive.</l>
<l>By thee the child was sent away</l>
<l>Beneath his grandsire's roof to stay.</l>
<l>Even in stocks and stones perforce</l>
<l>Will friendship spring from intercourse.</l>
<l>The young Śatrughna too would go</l>
<l>With Bharat, for he loved him so.</l>
<l>As Lakshmaṇ still to Ráma cleaves,</l>
<l>He his dear Bharat never leaves.</l>
<l>There is an ancient tale they tell:</l>
<l>A tree the foresters would fell</l>
<l>Was saved by reeds that round it stood,</l>
<l>For love that sprang of neighbourhood.</l>
<l>So Lakshmaṇ Ráma will defend,</l>
<l>And each on each for aid depend.</l>
<l>Such fame on earth their friendship wins</l>
<l>As that which binds the Heavenly Twins.</l>
<l>And Ráma ne'er will purpose wrong</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ, for their love is strong.</l>
<l>But Bharat, Oh, of this be sure,</l>
<l>Must evil at his hands endure.</l>
<l>Come, Ráma from his home expel</l>
<l>An exile in the woods to dwell.</l>
<l>The plan, O Queen, which I advise</l>
<l>Secures thy weal if thou be wise.</l>
<l>So we and all thy kith and kin</l>
<l>Advantage from thy gain shall win.</l>
<l>Shall Bharat, meet for happier fate,</l>
<l>Born to endure his rival's hate,</l>
<l>With all his fortune ruined cower</l>
<l>And dread his brother's mightier power!</l>
<l>Up, Queen, to save thy son, arise;</l>
<l>Prostrate at Ráma's feet he lies.</l>
<l>So the proud elephant who leads</l>
<l>His trooping consorts through the reeds</l>
<l>Falls in the forest shade beneath</l>
<l>The lion's spring and murderous teeth.</l>
<l>Scorned by thee in thy bliss and pride</l>
<l>Kauśalyá was of old defied,</l>

<l>When Gods and demons fought of old,</l>
<l>Thy lord, with royal saints enrolled,</l>
<l>Sped to the war with thee to bring</l>
<l>His might to aid the Immortals' King.</l>
<l>Far to the southern land he sped</l>
<l>Where Daṇḍak's mighty wilds are spread,</l>

<l>By Śambara, whose flag displayd</l>
<l>The hugest monster of the sea.</l>

<l>With might which Gods could never blame</l>

<l>Thou for no favour then wouldst sue,</l>

<l>So turned he to her bower to cheer</l>
<l>With the glad news his darling's ear.</l>
<l>Majestic, as the Lord of Night,</l>
<l>When threatened by the Dragon's might,</l>
<l>Bursts radiant on the evening sky</l>
<l>Pale with the clouds that wander by,</l>
<l>So Daśaratha, great in fame,</l>
<l>To Queen Kaikeyí's palace came.</l>
<l>There parrots flew from tree to tree,</l>
<l>And gorgeous peacocks wandered free,</l>
<l>While ever and anon was heard</l>
<l>The note of some glad water-bird.</l>
<l>Here loitered dwarf and hump-backed maid,</l>
<l>There lute and lyre sweet music played.</l>
<l>Here, rich in blossom, creepers twined</l>
<l>O'er grots with wondrous art designed,</l>
<l>There Champac and Aśoka flowers</l>
<l>Hung glorious o'er the summer bowers,</l>
<l>And mid the waving verdure rose</l>
<l>Gold, silver, ivory porticoes.</l>
<l>Through all the months in ceaseless store</l>
<l>The trees both fruit and blossom bore.</l>
<l>With many a lake the grounds were graced;</l>
<l>Seats gold and silver, here were placed;</l>
<l>Here every viand wooed the taste,</l>
<l>It was a garden meet to vie</l>
<l>E'en with the home of Gods on high.</l>
<l>Within the mansion rich and vast</l>
<l>The mighty Daśaratha passed:</l>
<l>Not there was his beloved queen</l>
<l>On her fair couch reclining seen.</l>
<l>With love his eager pulses beat</l>
<l>For the dear wife he came to meet,</l>
<l>And in his blissful hopes deceived,</l>
<l>He sought his absent love and grieved.</l>
<l>For never had she missed the hour</l>
<l>Of meeting in her sumptuous bower,</l>
<l>And never had the king of men</l>
<l>Entered the empty room till then.</l>
<l>Still urged by love and anxious thought</l>
<l>News of his favourite queen he sought,</l>
<l>For never had his loving eyes</l>
<l>Found her or selfish or unwise.</l>
<l>Then spoke at length the warder maid,</l>
<l>With hands upraised and sore afraid:</l>

<l>The king, the world's imperial chief,</l>
<l>His lady lying on the ground</l>
<l>In most unqueenly posture, found.</l>
<l>The aged king, all pure within,</l>
<l>Saw the young queen resolved on sin,</l>
<l>Low on the ground, his own sweet wife,</l>
<l>To him far dearer than his life,</l>
<l>Like some fair creeping plant uptorn,</l>

<lg>
<l>The monarch, as Kaikeyí pressed</l>
<l>With cruel words her dire request,</l>
<l>Stood for a time absorbed in thought</l>
<l>While anguish in his bosom wrought.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Does some wild dream my heart assail?</q></l>
<l>Or do my troubled senses fail?</l>
<l>Does some dire portent scare my view?</l>
<l><q rend="post">Or frenzy's stroke my soul subdue?</q></l>
<l>Thus as he thought, his troubled mind</l>
<l>In doubt and dread no rest could find,</l>
<l>Distressed and trembling like a deer</l>
<l>Who sees the dreaded tigress near.</l>
<l>On the bare ground his limbs he threw,</l>
<l>And many a long deep sigh he drew,</l>
<l>Like a wild snake, with fury blind,</l>
<l>By charms within a ring confined.</l>
<l>Once as the monarch's fury woke,</l>
<l><q>Shame on thee!</q> from his bosom broke,</l>
<l>And then in sense-bewildering pain</l>
<l>He fainted on the ground again.</l>
<l>At length, when slowly strength returned,</l>
<l>He answered as his eyeballs burned</l>
<l>With the wild fury of his ire</l>
<l>Consuming her, as 'twere, with fire:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Fell traitress, thou whose thoughts design</q></l>
<l>The utter ruin of my line,</l>
<l>What wrong have I or Ráma done?</l>
<l>Speak murderess, speak thou wicked one,</l>
<l>Seeks he not evermore to please</l>
<l>Thee with all sonlike courtesies?</l>
<l>By what persuasion art thou led</l>
<l>To bring this ruin on his head?</l>
<l>Ah me, that fondly unaware</l>
<l>I brought thee home my life to share,</l>
<l>Called daughter of a king, in truth</l>
<l>A serpent with a venomed tooth!</l>
<l>What fault can I pretend to find</l>
<l>In Ráma praised by all mankind,</l>
<l>That I my darling should forsake?</l>
<l>No, take my life, my glory take:</l>
<l>Let either queen be from me torn,</l>
<l>But not my well-loved eldest-born.</l>
<l>Him but to see is highest bliss,</l>
<l>And death itself his face to miss.</l>
<l>The world may sunless stand, the grain</l>
<l>May thrive without the genial rain,</l>
<l>But if my Ráma be not nigh</l>
<l>My spirit from its frame will fly.</l>
<l>Enough, thine impious plan forgo,</l>
<l>O thou who plottest sin and woe.</l>
<l>My head before thy feet, I kneel,</l>
<l>And pray thee some compassion feel.</l>
<l>O wicked dame, what can have led</l>
<l>Thy heart to dare a plot so dread?</l>
<l>Perchance thy purpose is to sound</l>
<l>The grace thy son with me has found;</l>
<l>Perchance the words that, all these days,</l>
<l>Thou still hast said in Ráma's praise,</l>
<l>Were only feigned, designed to cheer</l>
<l>With flatteries a father's ear.</l>
<l>Soon as thy grief, my Queen, I knew,</l>
<l>My bosom felt the anguish too.</l>
<l>In empty halls art thou possessed,</l>
<l>And subject to anothers' hest?</l>
<l>Now on Ikshváku's ancient race</l>
<l>Falls foul disorder and disgrace,</l>
<l>If thou, O Queen, whose heart so long</l>
<l>Has loved the good should choose the wrong.</l>
<l>Not once, O large-eyed dame, hast thou</l>
<l>Been guilty of offence till now,</l>
<l>Nor said a word to make me grieve,</l>
<l>Now will I now thy sin believe.</l>
<l>With thee my Ráma used to hold</l>
<l>Like place with Bharat lofty-souled.</l>
<l>As thou so often, when the pair</l>
<l>Were children yet, wouldst fain declare.</l>
<l>And can thy righteous soul endure</l>
<l>That Ráma glorious, pious, pure,</l>
<l>Should to the distant wilds be sent</l>
<l>For fourteen years of banishment?</l>
<l>Yea, Ráma Bharat's self exceeds</l>
<l>In love to thee and sonlike deeds,</l>
<l>And, for deserving love of thee,</l>
<l>As Bharat, even so is he.</l>
<l>Who better than that chieftain may</l>
<l>Obedience, love, and honour pay,</l>
<l>Thy dignity with care protect,</l>

<l>Of all his countless followers none</l>
<l>Can breathe a word against my son;</l>
<l>Of many thousands not a dame</l>
<l>Can hint reproach or whisper blame.</l>
<l>All creatures feel the sweet control</l>

<l>The love that ne'er betrays a friend,</l>
<l>The rectitude that naught can bend,</l>
<l>Knowledge, and meek obedience grace</l>

<l>For short will be my days, I ween,</l>
<l>When I with mournful eyes have seen</l>
<l>My Ráma wandering forth alone</l>

<l>Ah me! my fond belief I rue.</l>
<l>Vile traitress, loved as good and true,</l>
<l>As one who in his thirst has quaffed,</l>
<l>Deceived by looks, a deadly draught.</l>
<l>Ah! thou hast slain me, murderess, while</l>
<l>Soothing my soul with words of guile,</l>
<l>As the wild hunter kills the deer</l>
<l>Lured from the brake his song to hear.</l>
<l>Soon every honest tongue will fling</l>
<l>Reproach on the dishonest king;</l>
<l>The people's scorn in every street</l>
<l>The seller of his child will meet,</l>

<l>As whelms a Bráhman drunk with wine.</l>
<l>Ah me, for my unhappy fate,</l>
<l>Compelled thy words to tolerate!</l>
<l>Such woe is sent to scourge a crime</l>
<l>Committed in some distant time.</l>
<l>For many a day with sinful care</l>
<l>I cherished thee, thou sin and snare,</l>
<l>Kept thee, unwitting, like a cord</l>
<l>Destined to bind its hapless lord.</l>
<l>Mine hours of ease I spent with thee,</l>
<l>Nor deemed my love my death would be,</l>
<l>While like a heedless child I played,</l>
<l>On a black snake my hand I laid.</l>
<l>A cry from every mouth will burst</l>

<l>But yet the moon-crowned night could bring</l>

<l>As still he mourned with burning sighs</l>

<l><q rend="pre">O Night whom starry fires adorn,</q></l>

<l>This, only this, is all my claim:</l>

<l>The wicked queen her speech renewed,</l>

<l>For his dear Ráma sorrowing:</l>

<l>Alarka, when a Bráhman famed</l>
<l>For Scripture lore his promise claimed,</l>
<l>Tore from his head his bleeding eyes</l>
<l>And unreluctant gave the prize.</l>
<l>His narrow bounds prescribed restrain</l>
<l>The Rivers' Lord, the mighty main,</l>
<l>Who, though his waters boil and rave,</l>
<l>Keeps faithful to the word he gave.</l>
<l>Truth all religion comprehends,</l>
<l>Through all the world its might extends:</l>
<l>In truth alone is justice placed,</l>
<l>On truth the words of God are based:</l>
<l>A life in truth unchanging past</l>
<l>Will bring the highest bliss at last.</l>
<l>If thou the right would still pursue,</l>
<l>Be constant to thy word and true:</l>
<l>Let me thy promise fruitful see,</l>
<l>For boons, O King, proceed from thee.</l>
<l>Now to preserve thy righteous fame,</l>

<l>He drew a little space aside.</l>
<l>Then, as the king, with misery weak,</l>
<l>With vain endeavour strove to speak,</l>
<l>Kaikeyí, skilled in plot and plan,</l>
<l>To sage Sumantra thus began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The king, absorbed in joyful thought</q></l>
<l>For his dear son, no rest has sought:</l>
<l>Sleepless to him the night has past,</l>
<l>And now o'erwatched he sinks at last.</l>
<l>Then go, Sumantra, and with speed</l>
<l>The glorious Ráma hither lead:</l>
<l>Go, as I pray, nor longer wait;</l>
<l><q rend="post">No time is this to hesitate.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">How can I go, O Lady fair,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Unless my lord his will declare?</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q>Fain would I see him,</q> cried the king,</l>
<l><q>Quick, quick, my beauteous Ráma bring.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rose the happy thought to cheer</l>
<l>The bosom of the charioteer,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The king, I ween, of pious mind,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The consecration has designed.</q></l>
<l>Sumantra for his wisdom famed,</l>
<l>Delighted with the thought he framed,</l>
<l>From the calm chamber, like a bay</l>
<l>Of crowded ocean, took his way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He turned his face to neither side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"> But forth he hurried straight;</l>
<l>Only a little while he eyed</l>
<l>The guards who kept the gate.</l>
<l>He saw in front a gathered crowd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of men of every class,</l>
<l>Who, parting as he came, allowed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The charioteer to pass.</l>

<head>Canto XV. The Preparations.</head>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There slept the Bráhmans, deeply read</l>
<l>In Scripture, till the night had fled;</l>
<l>Then, with the royal chaplains, they</l>
<l>Took each his place in long array.</l>
<l>There gathered fast the chiefs of trade,</l>
<l>Nor peer nor captain long delayed,</l>
<l>Assembling all in order due</l>
<l>The consecrating rite to view.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The morning dawned with cloudless ray</l>
<l>On Pushya's high auspicious day,</l>
<l>And Cancer with benignant power</l>
<l>Looked down on Ráma's natal hour.</l>
<l>The twice-born chiefs, with zealous heed,</l>
<l>Made ready what the rite would need.</l>
<l>The well-wrought throne of holy wood</l>
<l>And golden urns in order stood.</l>
<l>There was the royal car whereon</l>
<l>A tiger's skin resplendent shone;</l>
<l>There water, brought for sprinkling thence</l>
<l>Where, in their sacred confluence,</l>
<l>Blend Jumná's waves with Gangá's tide,</l>
<l>From many a holy flood beside,</l>
<l>From brook and fountain far and near,</l>
<l>From pool and river, sea and mere.</l>
<l>And there were honey, curd, and oil,</l>
<l>Parched rice and grass, the garden's spoil,</l>
<l>Fresh milk, eight girls in bright attire,</l>
<l>An elephant with eyes of fire;</l>
<l>And urns of gold and silver made,</l>
<l>With milky branches overlaid,</l>
<l>All brimming from each sacred flood,</l>
<l>And decked with many a lotus bud.</l>
<pb n="110"/><anchor id="Pg110"/>
<l>And dancing-women fair and free,</l>
<l>Gay with their gems, were there to see,</l>
<l>Who stood in bright apparel by</l>
<l>With lovely brow and witching eye.</l>
<l>White flashed the jewelled chouri there,</l>
<l>And shone like moonbeams through the air;</l>
<l>The white umbrella overhead</l>
<l>A pale and moonlike lustre shed,</l>
<l>Wont in pure splendour to precede,</l>
<l>And in such rites the pomp to lead.</l>
<l>There stood the charger by the side</l>
<l>Of the great bull of snow-white hide;</l>
<l>There was all music soft and loud,</l>
<l>And bards and minstrels swelled the crowd.</l>
<l>For now the monarch bade combine</l>
<l>Each custom of his ancient line</l>
<l>With every rite Ayodhyá's state</l>
<l>Observed, her kings to consecrate.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, summoned by the king's behest,</l>
<l>The multitudes together pressed,</l>
<l>And, missing still the royal sire,</l>
<l>Began, impatient, to inquire:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Who to our lord will tidings bear</q></l>
<l>That all his people throng the square?</l>
<l>Where is the king? the sun is bright,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And all is ready for the rite.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus they spoke, Sumantra, tried</l>
<l>In counsel, to the chiefs replied,</l>
<l>Gathered from lands on every side:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">To Ráma's house I swiftly drave,</q></l>
<l>For so the king his mandate gave.</l>
<l>Our aged lord and Ráma too</l>
<l>In honour high hold all of you:</l>
<l>I in your words (be long your days!)</l>
<l><q rend="post">Will ask him why he thus delays.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the peer in Scripture read,</l>
<l>And to the ladies' bower he sped.</l>
<l>Quick through the gates Sumantra hied,</l>
<l>Which access ne'er to him denied.</l>
<l>Behind the curtained screen he drew,</l>
<l>Which veiled the chamber from the view.</l>
<l>In benediction loud he raised</l>
<l>His voice, and thus the monarch praised:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Sun, Moon, Kuvera, Śiva bless</q></l>
<l>Kakutstha's son with high success!</l>
<l>The Lords of air, flood, fire decree</l>
<l>The victory, my King, to thee!</l>
<l>The holy night has past away,</l>
<l>Auspicious shines the morning's ray.</l>
<l>Rise, Lord of men, thy part to take</l>
<l>In the great rite. Awake! awake!</l>
<l>Bráhmans and captains, chiefs of trade,</l>
<l>All wait in festive garb arrayed;</l>
<l>For thee they look with eager eyes:</l>
<l><q rend="post">O Raghu's son, awake! arise.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him in holy Scripture read,</l>
<l>Who hailed him thus, the monarch said,</l>
<l>Upraising from his sleep his head:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Go, Ráma, hither lead as thou</q></l>
<l>Wast ordered by the queen but now.</l>
<l>Come, tell me why my mandate laid</l>
<l>Upon thee thus is disobeyed.</l>
<l>Away! and Ráma hither bring;</l>
<l><q rend="post">I sleep not: make no tarrying.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus gave the king command anew:</l>
<l>Sumantra from his lord withdrew;</l>
<l>With head in lowly reverence bent,</l>
<l>And filled with thoughts of joy, he went.</l>
<l>The royal street he traversed, where</l>
<l>Waved flag and pennon to the air,</l>
<l>And, as with joy the car he drove,</l>
<l>He let his eyes delighted rove.</l>
<l>On every side, where'er he came,</l>
<l>He heard glad words, their theme the same,</l>
<l>As in their joy the gathered folk</l>
<l>Of Ráma and the throning spoke.</l>
<l>Then saw he Ráma's palace bright</l>
<l>And vast as Mount Kailása's height,</l>
<l>That glorious in its beauty showed</l>
<l>As Indra's own supreme abode:</l>
<l>With folding doors both high and wide;</l>
<l>With hundred porches beautified:</l>
<l>Where golden statues towering rose</l>
<l>O'er gemmed and coralled porticoes.</l>
<l>Bright like a cave in Meru's side,</l>
<l>Or clouds through Autumn's sky that ride:</l>
<l>Festooned with length of bloomy twine,</l>
<l>Flashing with pearls and jewels' shine,</l>
<l>While sandal-wood and aloe lent</l>
<l>The mingled riches of their scent;</l>
<l>With all the odorous sweets that fill</l>
<l>The breezy heights of Dardar's hill.</l>
<l>There by the gate the Sáras screamed,</l>
<l>And shrill-toned peacocks' plumage gleamed.</l>
<l>Its floors with deftest art inlaid,</l>
<l>Its sculptured wolves in gold arrayed,</l>
<l>With its bright sheen the palace took</l>
<l>The mind of man and chained the look,</l>
<l>For like the sun and moon it glowed,</l>
<l>And mocked Kuvera's loved abode.</l>
<l>Circling the walls a crowd he viewed</l>
<l>Who stood in reverent attitude,</l>
<l>With throngs of countrymen who sought</l>
<l>Acceptance of the gifts they brought.</l>
<l>The elephant was stationed there,</l>
<l>Appointed Ráma's self to bear;</l>
<l>Adorned with pearls, his brow and cheek</l>
<l>Were sandal-dyed in many a streak,</l>
<l>While he, in stature, bulk, and pride,</l>
<l>With Indra's own Airávat<note place="foot">The elephant of Indra.</note> vied.</l>
<l>Sumantra, borne by coursers fleet,</l>
<l>Flashing a radiance o'er the street,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Ráma's palace flew,</l>
<l>And all who lined the royal road,</l>
<l>Or thronged the prince's rich abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rejoiced as near he drew.</l>
<l>And with delight his bosom swelled</l>
<l>As onward still his course he held</l>
<pb n="111"/><anchor id="Pg111"/>
<l>Through many a sumptuous court</l>
<l>Like Indra's palace nobly made,</l>
<l>Where peacocks revelled in the shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And beasts of silvan sort.</l>
<l>Through many a hall and chamber wide,</l>
<l>That with Kailása's splendour vied.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or mansions of the Blest,</l>
<l>While Ráma's friends, beloved and tried,</l>
<l>Before his coming stepped aside,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still on Sumantra pressed.</l>
<l>He reached the chamber door, where stood</l>
<l>Around his followers young and good,</l>
<l>Bard, minstrel, charioteer,</l>
<l>Well skilled the tuneful chords to sweep,</l>
<l>With soothing strain to lull to sleep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or laud their master dear.</l>
<l>Then, like a dolphin darting through</l>
<l>Unfathomed depths of ocean's blue</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With store of jewels decked,</l>
<l>Through crowded halls that rock-like rose,</l>
<l>Or as proud hills where clouds repose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sumantra sped unchecked—</l>
<l>Halls like the glittering domes on high</l>
<l>Reared for the dwellers of the sky</l>

<head>Canto XVI. Ráma Summoned.</head>

<lg>
<l>So through the crowded inner door</l>
<l>Sumantra, skilled in ancient lore,</l>
<l>On to the private chambers pressed</l>
<l>Which stood apart from all the rest.</l>
<l>There youthful warriors, true and bold,</l>
<l>Whose ears were ringed with polished gold,</l>
<l>All armed with trusty bows and darts,</l>
<l>Watched with devoted eyes and hearts.</l>
<l>And hoary men, a faithful train,</l>
<l>Whose aged hands held staves of cane,</l>
<l>The ladies' guard, apparelled fair</l>
<l>In red attire, were stationed there.</l>
<l>Soon as they saw Sumantra nigh,</l>
<l>Each longed his lord to gratify,</l>
<l>And from his seat beside the door</l>
<l>Up sprang each ancient servitor.</l>
<l>Then to the warders quickly cried</l>
<l>The skilled Sumantra, void of pride:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Tell Ráma that the charioteer</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Sumantra waits for audience here.</q></l>
<l>The ancient men with one accord</l>
<l>Seeking the pleasure of their lord,</l>
<l>Passing with speed the chamber door</l>
<l>To Ráma's ear the message bore.</l>
<l>Forthwith the prince with duteous heed</l>
<l>Called in the messenger with speed,</l>
<l>For 'twas his sire's command, he knew,</l>
<l>That sent him for the interview.</l>
<l>Like Lord Kuvera, well arrayed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He pressed a couch of gold,</l>
<l>Wherefrom a covering of brocade</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hung down in many a fold.</l>
<l>Oil and the sandal's fragrant dust</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had tinged his body o'er</l>
<l>Dark as the stream the spearman's thrust</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drains from the wounded boar.</l>
<l>Him Sítá watched with tender care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A chouri in her hand,</l>
<l>As Chitrá,<note place="foot">A star in the spike of Virgo: hence

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beside the Moon will stand.</l>
<l>Him glorious with unborrowed light,</l>
<l>A liberal lord, of sunlike might,</l>
<l>Sumantra hailed in words like these,</l>
<l>Well skilled in gentle courtesies,</l>
<l>As, with joined hands in reverence raised,</l>
<l>Upon the beauteous prince he gazed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Happy Kauśalyá! Blest is she,</q></l>
<l>The Mother of a son like thee.</l>
<l>Now rise, O Ráma, speed away.</l>
<l>Go to thy sire without delay:</l>
<l>For he and Queen Kaikeyí seek</l>
<l><q rend="post">An interview with thee to speak.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lion-lord of men, the best</l>
<l>Of splendid heroes, thus addressed,</l>
<l>To Sítá spake with joyful cheer:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The king and queen, my lady dear,</q></l>
<l>Touching the throning, for my sake</l>
<l>Some salutary counsel take.</l>
<l>The lady of the full black eye</l>
<l>Would fain her husband gratify,</l>
<l>And, all his purpose understood,</l>
<l>Counsels the monarch to my good.</l>
<l>A happy fate is mine, I ween,</l>
<l>When he, consulting with his queen,</l>
<l>Sumantra on this charge, intent</l>
<l>Upon my gain and good, has sent.</l>
<l>An envoy of so noble sort</l>
<l>Well suits the splendour of the court.</l>
<l>The consecration rite this day</l>
<l>Will join me in imperial sway.</l>
<l>To meet the lord of earth, for so</l>
<l>His order bids me, I will go.</l>
<l>Thou, lady, here in comfort stay,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And with thy maidens rest or play.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma spake. For meet reply</l>
<l>The lady of the large black eye</l>
<l>Attended to the door her lord,</l>
<l>And blessings on his head implored:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The majesty and royal state</q></l>
<l>Which holy Bráhmans venerate,</l>
<l>The consecration and the rite</l>
<l>Which sanctifies the ruler's might,</l>
<l>And all imperial powers should be</l>
<l>Thine by thy father's high decree,</l>
<l>As He, the worlds who formed and planned,</l>
<l>The kingship gave to Indra's hand.</l>
<pb n="112"/><anchor id="Pg112"/>
<l>Then shall mine eyes my king adore</l>
<l>When lustral rites and fast are o'er,</l>
<l>And black deer's skin and roebuck's horn</l>
<l>Thy lordly limbs and hand adorn.</l>
<l>May He whose hands the thunder wield</l>
<l>Be in the east thy guard and shield;</l>
<l>May Yáma's care the south befriend,</l>
<l>And Varuṇ's arm the west defend;</l>
<l>And let Kuvera, Lord of Gold,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The north with firm protection hold.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma spoke a kind farewell,</l>
<l>And hailed the blessings as they fell</l>
<l>From Sítá's gentle lips; and then,</l>
<l>As a young lion from his den</l>
<l>Descends the mountain's stony side,</l>
<l>So from the hall the hero hied.</l>
<l>First Lakshmaṇ at the door he viewed</l>
<l>Who stood in reverent attitude,</l>
<l>Then to the central court he pressed</l>
<l>Where watched the friends who loved him best.</l>
<l>To all his dear companions there</l>
<l>He gave kind looks and greeting fair.</l>
<l>On to the lofty car that glowed</l>
<l>Like fire the royal tiger strode.</l>
<l>Bright as himself its silver shone:</l>
<l>A tiger's skin was laid thereon.</l>
<l>With cloudlike thunder, as it rolled,</l>
<l>It flashed with gems and burnished gold,</l>
<l>And, like the sun's meridian blaze,</l>
<l>Blinded the eye that none could gaze.</l>
<l>Like youthful elephants, tall and strong,</l>
<l>Fleet coursers whirled the car along:</l>
<l>In such a car the Thousand-eyed</l>
<l>Borne by swift horses loves to ride.</l>
<l>So like Parjanya,<note place="foot">The Rain-God.</note> when he flies</l>
<l>Thundering through the autumn skies,</l>
<l>The hero from the palace sped,</l>
<l>As leaves the moon some cloud o'erhead.</l>
<l>Still close to Ráma Lakshmaṇ kept,</l>
<l>Behind him to the car he leapt,</l>
<l>And, watching with fraternal care,</l>
<l>Waved the long chouri's silver hair,</l>
<l>As from the palace gate he came</l>
<l>Up rose the tumult of acclaim.</l>
<l>While loud huzza and jubilant shout</l>
<l>Pealed from the gathered myriads out.</l>
<l>Then elephants, like mountains vast,</l>
<l>And steeds who all their kind surpassed,</l>
<l>Followed their lord by hundreds, nay</l>
<l>By thousands, led in long array.</l>
<l>First marched a band of warriors trained,</l>
<l>With sandal dust and aloe stained;</l>
<l>Well armed was each with sword and bow,</l>
<l>And every breast with hope aglow,</l>
<l>And ever, as they onward went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shouts from the warrior train,</l>
<l>And every sweet-toned instrument</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prolonged the minstrel strain.</l>
<l>On passed the tamer of his foes,</l>
<l>While well clad dames, in crowded rows,</l>
<l>Each chamber lattice thronged to view,</l>
<l>And chaplets on the hero threw.</l>
<l>Then all, of peerless face and limb,</l>
<l>Sang Ráma's praise for love of him,</l>
<l>And blent their voices, soft and sweet,</l>
<l>From palace high and crowded street:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now, sure, Kauśalyá's heart must swell</q></l>
<l>To see the son she loves so well,</l>
<l>Thee Ráma, thee, her joy and pride,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Triumphant o'er the realm preside.</q></l>
<l>Then—for they knew his bride most fair</l>
<l>Of all who part the soft dark hair,</l>
<l>His love, his life, possessed the whole</l>
<l>Of her young hero's heart and soul:—</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Be sure the lady's fate repays</q></l>

<l>As Ráma, rendering blithe and gay</l>

<l>Of mingled people numberless.</l>
<l>The royal street he traversed, where</l>
<l>Incense of aloe filled the air,</l>
<l>Where rose high palaces, that vied</l>

<l>With flowers of myriad colours graced.</l>
<l>And food for every varied taste,</l>
<l>Bright as the glowing path o'erhead</l>
<l>Which feet of Gods celestial tread,</l>
<l>Loud benedictions, sweet to hear,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such were the words and pleasant speech</l>

<l>As onward through the street he sped,</l>

<l>He could not speak or look on him.</l>
<l>Then sudden fear made Ráma shake</l>
<l>As though his foot had roused a snake,</l>
<l>Soon as his eyes had seen the change</l>
<l>So mournful, terrible, and strange.</l>
<l>For there his reason well-nigh fled,</l>
<l>Sighing, with soul disquieted,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To torturing pangs a prey,</l>
<l>Dismayed, despairing, and distraught,</l>
<l>In a fierce whirl of wildering thought</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hapless monarch lay,</l>
<l>Like Ocean wave-engarlanded</l>
<l>Storm-driven from his tranquil bed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Sun-God in eclipse,</l>
<l>Or like a holy seer, heart-stirred</l>
<l>With anguish, when a lying word</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has passed his heedless lips.</l>
<l>The sight of his dear father, pained</l>
<l>With woe and misery unexplained</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Filled Ráma with unrest,</l>
<l>As Ocean's pulses rise and swell</l>
<l>When the great moon he loves so well</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shines full upon his breast.</l>
<l>So grieving for his father's sake,</l>
<l>To his own heart the hero spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Why will the king my sire to-day</q></l>
<l>No kindly word of greeting say?</l>
<l>At other times, though wroth he be,</l>
<l>His eyes grow calm that look on me.</l>
<l>Then why does anguish wring his brow</l>
<l><q rend="post">To see his well-beloved now?</q></l>
<l>Sick and perplexed, distraught with woe,</l>
<l>To Queen Kaikeyí bowing low,</l>
<l>While pallor o'er his bright cheek spread,</l>
<l>With humble reverence he said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What have I done, unknown, amiss</q></l>
<l>To make my father wroth like this?</l>
<l>Declare it, O dear Queen, and win</l>
<l>His pardon for my heedless sin.</l>
<l>Why is the sire I ever find</l>
<l>Filled with all love to-day unkind?</l>
<l>With eyes cast down and pallid cheek</l>
<l>This day alone he will not speak.</l>
<l>Or lies he prostrate neath the blow</l>
<l>Of fierce disease or sudden woe?</l>
<l>For all our bliss is dashed with pain,</l>
<l>And joy unmixt is hard to gain.</l>
<l>Does stroke of evil fortune smite</l>
<l>Dear Bharat, charming to the sight,</l>
<l>Or on the brave Śatrughna fall,</l>
<l>Or consorts, for he loves them all?</l>
<l>Against his words when I rebel,</l>
<l>Or fail to please the monarch well,</l>
<l>When deeds of mine his soul offend,</l>
<l>That hour I pray my life may end.</l>
<l>How should a man to him who gave</l>
<l>His being and his life behave?</l>
<l>The sire to whom he owes his birth</l>
<l>Should be his deity on earth.</l>
<l>Hast thou, by pride and folly moved,</l>
<pb n="114"/><anchor id="Pg114"/>
<l>With bitter taunt the king reproved?</l>
<l>Has scorn of thine or cruel jest</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by the high-souled prince addressed,</l>
<l>Of Raghu's sons the chief and best,</l>
<l>She cast all ruth and shame aside,</l>

<l>Thou art so dear, his lips refrain</l>
<l>From words that might his darling pain.</l>
<l>But thou, as duty bids, must still</l>
<l>The promise of thy sire fulfil.</l>
<l>He who to me in days gone by</l>
<l>Vouchsafed a boon with honours high,</l>
<l>Dares now, a king, his word regret,</l>
<l>And caitiff-like disowns the debt.</l>
<l>The lord of men his promise gave</l>
<l>To grant the boon that I might crave,</l>
<l>And now a bridge would idly throw</l>
<l>When the dried stream has ceased to flow.</l>
<l>His faith the monarch must not break</l>
<l>In wrath, or e'en for thy dear sake.</l>
<l>From faith, as well the righteous know,</l>
<l>Our virtue and our merits flow.</l>
<l>Now, be they good or be they ill,</l>
<l>Do thou thy father's words fulfil:</l>
<l>Swear that his promise shall not fail,</l>
<l>And I will tell thee all the tale.</l>
<l>Yes, Ráma, when I hear that thou</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He heard, and with a troubled breast</l>
<l>This answer to the queen addressed:</l>

<l>I, at the bidding of my sire,</l>
<l>Would cast my body to the fire,</l>

<l>Or in the waves of ocean sink:</l>
<l>If he command, it shall be done,—</l>
<l>My father and my king in one.</l>
<l>Then speak and let me know the thing</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ended. To the princely youth</l>

<l>Transfixed with darts and bathed in gore</l>
<l>Two boons to me thy father gave</l>
<l>For the dear life 'twas mine to save.</l>

<l>That Bharat on the throne be set,</l>
<l>And thou, O Ráma, go this day</l>
<l>To Daṇḍak forest far away.</l>
<l>Now, Ráma, if thou wilt maintain</l>
<l>Thy father's faith without a stain,</l>
<l>And thine own truth and honour clear,</l>
<l>Then, best of men, my bidding hear.</l>
<l>Do thou thy father's word obey,</l>
<l>Nor from the pledge he gave me stray.</l>
<l>Thy life in Daṇḍak forest spend</l>
<l>Till nine long years and five shall end.</l>

<l>The monarch mourns thy altered fate</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus with cruel words she spoke,</l>

<lg>
<l>Calm and unmoved by threatened woe</l>
<l>The noble conqueror of the foe</l>
<l>Answered the cruel words she spoke,</l>
<l>Nor quailed beneath the murderous stroke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Yea, for my father's promise sake</q></l>
<l>I to the wood my way will take,</l>
<l>And dwell a lonely exile there</l>
<l>In hermit dress with matted hair.</l>
<l>One thing alone I fain would learn,</l>
<l>Why is the king this day so stern?</l>
<l>Why is the scourge of foes so cold,</l>
<l>Nor gives me greeting as of old?</l>
<l>Now let not anger flush thy cheek:</l>
<l>Before thy face the truth I speak,</l>
<l>In hermit's coat with matted hair</l>
<l>To the wild wood will I repair.</l>
<l>How can I fail his will to do,</l>
<l>Friend, master, grateful sovereign too?</l>
<l>One only pang consumes my breast:</l>
<l>That his own lips have not expressed</l>
<l>His will, nor made his longing known</l>
<l>That Bharat should ascend the throne.</l>
<pb n="115"/><anchor id="Pg115"/>
<l>To Bharat I would yield my wife,</l>

<l>More gladly when the gift may free</l>
<l>His honour and bring joy to thee.</l>
<l>Thus, lady, his sad heart release</l>
<l>From the sore shame, and give him peace.</l>
<l>But tell me, O, I pray thee, why</l>
<l>The lord of men, with downcast eye,</l>

<l>Down his pale cheek the tear-drops run.</l>
<l>Let couriers to thy father speed</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Ráma thus had made reply</l>
<l>Kaikeyí's heart with joy beat high.</l>
<l>She, trusting to the pledge she held,</l>

<l>Then swooning, with his wits astray,</l>
<l>Upon the gold-wrought couch he lay,</l>
<l>And Ráma raised the aged king:</l>
<l>But the stern queen, unpitying,</l>
<l>Checked not her needless words, nor spared</l>
<l>The hero for all speed prepared,</l>
<l>But urged him with her bitter tongue,</l>
<l>Like a good horse with lashes stung,</l>
<l>She spoke her shameful speech. Serene</l>
<l>He heard the fury of the queen,</l>
<l>And to her words so vile and dread</l>
<l>Gently, unmoved in mind, he said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I would not in this world remain</q></l>
<l>A grovelling thrall to paltry gain,</l>
<l>But duty's path would fain pursue,</l>
<l>True as the saints themselves are true.</l>
<l>From death itself I would not fly</l>
<l>My father's wish to gratify,</l>
<l>What deed soe'er his loving son</l>
<l>May do to please him, think it done.</l>
<l>Amid all duties, Queen, I count</l>
<l>This duty first and paramount,</l>
<l>That sons, obedient, aye fulfil</l>
<l>Their honoured fathers' word and will.</l>
<l>Without his word, if thou decree,</l>
<l>Forth to the forest will I flee,</l>

<l>Mid lonely wilds in banishment.</l>
<l>Methinks thou couldst not hope to find</l>
<l>One spark of virtue in my mind,</l>
<l>If thou, whose wish is still my lord,</l>
<l>Hast for this grace the king implored.</l>
<l>This day I go, but, ere we part,</l>
<l>Must cheer my Sítá's tender heart,</l>
<l>To my dear mother bid farewell;</l>
<l>Then to the woods, a while to dwell.</l>
<l>With thee, O Queen, the care must rest</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In speechless woe the father heard,</l>

<l>Then from the bower the hero went.</l>
<l>Soon as he reached the gate he found</l>
<l>His dear companions gathered round.</l>
<l>Behind him came Sumitrá's child</l>

<l>Then saw he all that rich array</l>

<l>Round them with reverent stops he paced,</l>

<l>Now to the exile's lot resigned</l>
<l>He left the rule of earth behind:</l>
<l>As though all worldly cares he spurned</l>
<l>No trouble was in him discerned.</l>
<l>The chouries that for kings are used,</l>
<l>And white umbrella, he refused,</l>
<l>Dismissed his chariot and his men,</l>
<l>And every friend and citizen.</l>
<l>He ruled his senses, nor betrayed</l>
<l>The grief that on his bosom weighed,</l>
<l>And thus his mother's mansion sought</l>
<l>To tell the mournful news he brought.</l>
<l>Nor could the gay-clad people there</l>
<l>Who flocked round Ráma true and fair,</l>
<l>One sign of altered fortune trace</l>

<l>Nor had the chieftain, mighty-armed,</l>

<l>As e'en from autumn moons is thrown</l>

<l>Lakshmaṇ the brave, his brother's peer</l>
<l>In princely virtues, followed near,</l>
<l>Sore troubled, but resolved to show</l>
<l>No token of his secret woe.</l>

<l>But in the monarch's palace, when</l>

<l>A mighty wail and wild lament:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah, he who ever freely did</q></l>
<l>His duty ere his sire could bid,</l>
<l>Our refuge and our sure defence,</l>
<l>This day will go an exile hence,</l>

<l>Most tender and affectionate,</l>

<l>On themes that sting he will not speak,</l>

the ladies grieved,</l>

<l>Their lamentation, mixed with tears,</l>

<l>Who, burnt with woe too great to bear,</l>
<l>Fell on his couch and fainted there.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma, smitten with the pain</l>
<l>His heaving heart could scarce restrain,</l>
<l>Groaned like an elephant and strode</l>

<l>A warder there, whose hoary eld</l>

<l>Of victor chiefs preëminent.</l>
<l>One court he passed, and in the next</l>
<l>Saw, masters of each Veda text,</l>
<l>A crowd of Bráhmans, good and sage,</l>
<l>Dear to the king for lore and age.</l>
<l>To these he bowed his reverent head,</l>
<l>Thence to the court beyond he sped.</l>
<l>Old dames and tender girls, their care</l>

<l>And all, when Ráma came in view,</l>
<l>Delighted to the chamber flew,</l>
<l>To bear to Queen Kauśalyá's ear</l>
<l>The tidings that she loved to hear.</l>
<l>The queen, on rites and prayer intent,</l>
<l>In careful watch the night had spent,</l>

<l>Firm in her vows, serenely glad,</l>
<l>In robes of spotless linen clad,</l>
<l>As texts prescribe, with grace implored,</l>

<l>Within her splendid bower he came,</l>

<l>With wreaths, and curds, and cates, and wood,</l>

<l>She, worn and pale with many a fast</l>

<l>Whose hopeless days must still be spent</l>
<l>In grief that ends not and lament?</l>
<l>They scorned me when my son was nigh;</l>
<l>When he is banished I must die.</l>
<l>Me, whom my husband never prized,</l>
<l>Kaikeyí's retinue despised</l>
<l>With boundless insolence, though she</l>
<l>Tops not in rank nor equals me.</l>
<l>And they who do me service yet,</l>
<l>Nor old allegiance quite forget,</l>
<l>Whene'er they see Kaikeyí's son,</l>
<l>With silent lips my glances shun.</l>
<l>How, O my darling, shall I brook</l>
<l>Each menace of Kaikeyí's look,</l>
<l>And listen, in my low estate,</l>
<l>To taunts of one so passionate?</l>
<l>For seventeen years since thou wast born</l>
<l>I sat and watched, ah me, forlorn!</l>
<l>Hoping some blessed day to see</l>
<l>Deliverance from my woes by thee.</l>
<l>Now comes this endless grief and wrong,</l>
<l>So dire I cannot bear it long,</l>
<l>Sinking, with age and sorrow worn,</l>
<l>Beneath my rivals' taunts and scorn.</l>
<l>How shall I pass in dark distress</l>
<l>My long lone days of wretchedness</l>
<l>Without my Ráma's face, as bright</l>
<l>As the full moon to cheer my sight?</l>
<l>Alas, my cares thy steps to train,</l>
<l>And fasts, and vows, and prayers are vain.</l>
<l>Hard, hard, I ween, must be this heart</l>
<l>To hear this blow nor burst apart,</l>
<l>As some great river bank, when first</l>
<l>The floods of Rain-time on it burst.</l>
<l>No, Fate that speeds not will not slay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Nor Yama's halls vouchsafe me room,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or, like a lion's weeping prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Death now had borne me to my doom.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hard is my heart and wrought of steel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">That breaks not with the crushing blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or in the pangs this day I feel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">My lifeless frame had sunk below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Death waits his hour, nor takes me now:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">But this sad thought augments my pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That prayer and largess, fast and vow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">And Heavenward service are in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah me, ah me! with fruitless toil</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Of rites austere a child I sought:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus seed cast forth on barren soil</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Still lifeless lies and comes to naught.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If ever wretch by anguish grieved</l>

<head>Canto XXI. Kausalyá Calmed.</head>

<lg>
<l>While thus Kauśalyá wept and sighed,</l>
<l>With timely words sad Lakshmaṇ cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O honoured Queen I like it ill</q></l>
<l>That, subject to a woman's will,</l>
<l>Ráma his royal state should quit</l>
<l>And to an exile's doom submit.</l>
<l>The aged king, fond, changed, and weak,</l>
<l>Will as the queen compels him speak.</l>
<l>But why should Ráma thus be sent</l>
<l>To the wild woods in banishment?</l>
<l>No least offence I find in him,</l>
<l>I see no fault his fame to dim.</l>
<l>Not one in all the world I know,</l>
<l>Not outcast wretch, not secret foe,</l>
<l>Whose whispering lips would dare assail</l>
<l>His spotless life with slanderous tale.</l>
<l>Godlike and bounteous, just, sincere,</l>
<l>E'en to his very foemen dear:</l>
<l>Who would without a cause neglect</l>
<l>The right, and such a son reject?</l>
<l>And if a king such order gave,</l>
<l>In second childhood, passion's slave,</l>
<l>What son within his heart would lay</l>
<l>The senseless order, and obey?</l>
<l>Come, Ráma, ere this plot be known</l>
<l>Stand by me and secure the throne.</l>
<l>Stand like the King who rules below,</l>
<l>Stand aided by thy brother's bow:</l>
<l>How can the might of meaner men</l>
<l>Resist thy royal purpose then?</l>
<l>My shafts, if rebels court their fate,</l>
<l>Shall lay Ayodhyá desolate.</l>
<l>Then shall her streets with blood be dyed</l>
<l>Of those who stand on Bharat's side:</l>
<l>None shall my slaughtering hand exempt,</l>
<l>For gentle patience earns contempt.</l>
<l>If, by Kaikeyí's counsel changed,</l>
<l>Our father's heart be thus estranged,</l>
<l>No mercy must our arm restrain,</l>
<l>But let the foe be slain, be slain.</l>
<l>For should the guide, respected long,</l>
<l>No more discerning right and wrong,</l>
<l>Turn in forbidden paths to stray,</l>
<l>'Tis meet that force his steps should stay.</l>
<l>What power sufficient can he see,</l>
<l>What motive for the wish has he,</l>
<l>That to Kaikeyí would resign</l>
<l>The empire which is justly thine?</l>
<l>Can he, O conqueror of thy foes,</l>
<l>Thy strength and mine in war oppose?</l>
<l>Can he entrust, in our despite,</l>
<l>To Bharat's hand thy royal right?</l>
<l>I love this brother with the whole</l>
<l>Affection of my faithful soul.</l>
<l>Yea Queen, by bow and truth I swear,</l>
<l>By sacrifice, and gift, and prayer,</l>
<l>If Ráma to the forest goes,</l>
<l>Or where the burning furnace glows,</l>
<l>First shall my feet the forest tread,</l>
<l>The flames shall first surround my head.</l>
<l>My might shall chase thy grief and tears,</l>
<l>As darkness flies when morn appears.</l>
<l>Do thou, dear Queen, and Ráma too</l>
<l>Behold what power like mine can do.</l>
<l>My aged father I will kill,</l>
<l>The vassal of Kaikeyí's will,</l>
<l>Old, yet a child, the woman's thrall,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Infirm, and base, the scorn of all.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Lakshmaṇ cried, the mighty-souled:</l>
<l>Down her sad cheeks the torrents rolled,</l>
<l>As to her son Kauśalyá spake:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Now thou hast heard thy brother, take</q></l>
<l>His counsel if thou hold it wise,</l>
<l>And do the thing his words advise,</l>
<l>Do not, my son, with tears I pray,</l>
<l>My rival's wicked word obey,</l>
<l>Leave me not here consumed with woe,</l>
<l>Nor to the wood, an exile, go.</l>
<l>If thou, to virtue ever true,</l>
<l>Thy duty's path would still pursue,</l>
<l>The highest duty bids thee stay</l>
<l>And thus thy mother's voice obey.</l>
<l>Thus Kaśyap's great ascetic son</l>
<l>A seat among the Immortals won:</l>
<l>In his own home, subdued, he stayed,</l>
<l>And honour to his mother paid.</l>
<l>If reverence to thy sire be due,</l>
<l>Thy mother claims like honour too,</l>
<l>And thus I charge thee, O my child,</l>
<l>Thou must not seek the forest wild.</l>
<l>Ah, what to me were life and bliss,</l>
<l>Condemned my darling son to miss?</l>
<l>But with my Ráma near, to eat</l>
<l>The very grass itself were sweet.</l>
<l>But if thou still wilt go and leave</l>
<l>Thy hapless mother here to grieve,</l>
<l>I from that hour will food abjure,</l>
<l>Nor life without my son endure.</l>
<l>Then it will be thy fate to dwell</l>
<l>In depth of world-detested hell.</l>
<l>As Ocean in the olden time</l>
<l>Was guilty of an impious crime</l>
<l>That marked the lord of each fair flood</l>
<l><q rend="post">As one who spills a Bráhman's blood.</q><note place="foot">The
commentators say that, in a former creation, Ocean grieved his mother and
suffered in consequence the pains of hell.</note></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the queen, and wept, and sighed:</l>
<l>Then righteous Ráma thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I have no power to slight or break</q></l>
<l>Commandments which my father spake.</l>
<l>I bend my head, dear lady, low,</l>
<l>Forgive me, for I needs must go.</l>
<l>Once Kaṇdu, mighty saint, who made</l>
<l>His dwelling in the forest shade,</l>
<pb n="119"/><anchor id="Pg119"/>
<l>A cow—and duty's claims he knew—</l>
<l>Obedient to his father, slew.</l>
<l>And in the line from which we spring,</l>
<l>When ordered by their sire the king,</l>
<l>Through earth the sons of Sagar cleft,</l>
<l>And countless things of life bereft.<note place="foot">As described
in <ref target="CantoI-XL">Book I Canto XL</ref>.</note></l>
<l>So Jamadagní's son<note place="foot">Parasúráma.</note> obeyed</l>
<l>His sire, when in the wood he laid</l>
<l>His hand upon his axe, and smote</l>
<l>Through Renuká his mother's throat.</l>
<l>The deeds of these and more beside.</l>
<l>Peers of the Gods, my steps shall guide,</l>
<l>And resolute will I fulfil</l>
<l>My father's word, my father's will.</l>
<l>Nor I, O Queen, unsanctioned tread</l>
<l>This righteous path, by duty led:</l>
<l>The road my footsteps journey o'er</l>
<l>Was traversed by the great of yore.</l>
<l>This high command which all accept</l>
<l>Shall faithfully by me be kept,</l>
<l>For duty ne'er will him forsake</l>
<l><q rend="post">Who fears his sire's command to break.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to his mother wild with grief:</l>
<l>Then thus to Lakshmaṇ spake the chief</l>
<l>Of those by whom the bow is bent,</l>
<l>Mid all who speak, most eloquent:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I know what love for me thou hast,</q></l>
<l>What firm devotion unsurpassed:</l>
<l>Thy valour and thy worth I know,</l>
<l>And glory that appals the foe.</l>
<l>Blest youth, my mother's woe is great,</l>
<l>It bends her 'neath its matchless weight:</l>
<l>No claims will she, with blinded eyes,</l>
<l>Of truth and patience recognize.</l>
<l>For duty is supreme in place,</l>
<l>And truth is duty's noblest base.</l>
<l>Obedient to my sire's behest</l>
<l>I serve the cause of duty best.</l>
<l>For man should truly do whate'er</l>
<l>To mother, Bráhman, sire, he sware:</l>
<l>He must in duty's path remain,</l>
<l>Nor let his word be pledged in vain.</l>
<l>And, O my brother, how can I</l>
<l>Obedience to this charge deny?</l>
<l>Kaikeyí's tongue my purpose spurred,</l>
<l>But 'twas my sire who gave the word.</l>
<l>Cast these unholy thoughts aside</l>
<l>Which smack of war and Warriors' pride;</l>
<l>To duty's call, not wrath attend,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And tread the path which I commend.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ráma by fond affection moved</l>
<l>His brother Lakshmaṇ thus reproved;</l>
<l>Then with joined hands and reverent head</l>
<l>Again to Queen Kauśalyá said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">I needs must go—do thou consent—</q></l>
<l>To the wild wood in banishment.</l>
<l>O give me, by my life I pray,</l>
<l>Thy blessing ere I go away.</l>
<l>I, when the promised years are o'er,</l>
<l>Shall see Ayodhyá's town once more.</l>
<l>Then, mother dear, thy tears restrain,</l>
<l>Nor let thy heart be wrung by pain:</l>
<l>In time, my father's will obeyed,</l>
<l>Shall I return from greenwood shade.</l>
<l>My dear Videhan, thou, and I,</l>
<l>Lakshmaṇ, Sumitrá, feel this tie,</l>
<l>And must my father's word obey,</l>
<l>As duty bids that rules for aye.</l>
<l>Thy preparations now forgo,</l>
<l>And lock within thy breast thy woe,</l>
<l>Nor be my pious wish withstood</l>
<l><q rend="post">To go an exile to the wood.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Calm and unmoved the prince explained</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His duty's claim and purpose high,</l>
<l>The mother life and sense regained,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Looked on her son and made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">If reverence be thy father's due,</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The same by right and love is mine:</l>
<l>Go not, my charge I thus renew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor leave me here in woe to pine,</l>
<l>What were such lonely life to me,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rites to the shades, or deathless lot?</l>
<l>More dear, my son, one hour with thee</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="post">Than all the world where thou art not.</q></l>
<l>As bursts to view, when brands blaze high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some elephant concealed by night,</l>
<l>So, when he heard his mother's cry,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Burnt Ráma's grief with fiercer might.</l>
<l>Thus to the queen, half senseless still,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Lakshmaṇ, burnt with heart-felt pain,</l>
<l>True to the right, with steadfast will,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His duteous speech he spoke again:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Brother, I know thy loving mind,</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy valour and thy truth I know,</l>
<l>But now to claims of duty blind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou and my mother swell my woe.</l>

<l>Dear when they meet as some fond wife</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With her sweet babes upon her breast.</l>
<l>But man to duty first should turn</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whene'er the three are not combined:</l>
<l>For those who heed but gain we spurn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And those to pleasure all resigned.</l>
<l>Shall then the virtuous disobey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hosts of an aged king and sire,</l>

<l>Shall she, while yet the holy king</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is living, on the right intent,—</l>
<l>Shall she, like some poor widowed thing,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go forth with me to banishment?</l>

<l>He soothed her thus, firm to the last</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His counsel to his brother told:</l>

<lg>
<l>So Ráma kept unshaken still</l>
<l>His noble heart with iron will.</l>
<l>To his dear brother next he turned,</l>
<l>Whose glaring eyes with fury burned,</l>
<l>Indignant, panting like a snake,</l>
<l>And thus again his counsel spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thine anger and thy grief restrain,</q></l>
<l>And firm in duty's path remain.</l>
<l>Dear brother, lay thy scorn aside,</l>
<l>And be the right thy joy and pride.</l>
<l>Thy ready zeal and thoughtful care</l>
<l>To aid what rites should grace the heir,—</l>
<l>These 'tis another's now to ask;</l>
<l>Come, gird thee for thy noble task,</l>
<l>That Bharat's throning rites may he</l>
<l>Graced with the things prepared for me.</l>
<l>And with thy gentle care provide</l>
<l>That her fond heart, now sorely tried</l>
<l>With fear and longing for my sake,</l>
<l>With doubt and dread may never ache.</l>
<l>To know that thoughts of coming ill</l>
<l>One hour that tender bosom fill</l>
<l>With agony and dark despair</l>
<l>Is grief too great for me to bear.</l>
<l>I cannot, brother, call to mind</l>
<l>One wilful fault or undesigned,</l>
<l>When I have pained in anything</l>
<l>My mothers or my sire the king.</l>
<l>The right my father keeps in view,</l>
<l>In promise, word, and action true;</l>
<l>Let him then all his fear dismiss,</l>
<l>Nor dread the loss of future bliss.</l>
<l>He fears his truth herein will fail:</l>
<l>Hence bitter thoughts his heart assail.</l>
<l>He trembles lest the rites proceed,</l>
<l>And at his pangs my heart should bleed.</l>
<l>So now this earnest wish is mine,</l>
<l>The consecration to resign,</l>
<l>And from this city turn away</l>
<l>To the wild wood with no delay.</l>
<l>My banishment to-day will free</l>
<l>Kaikeyí from her cares, that she,</l>
<l>At last contented and elate,</l>
<l>May Bharat's throning celebrate.</l>
<l>Then will the lady's trouble cease,</l>
<l>Then will her heart have joy and peace,</l>
<l>When wandering in the wood I wear</l>
<l>Deerskin, and bark, and matted hair.</l>
<l>Nor shall by me his heart be grieved</l>
<l>Whose choice approved, whose mind conceived</l>
<l>This counsel which I follow. No,</l>
<l>Forth to the forest will I go.</l>
<l>'Tis Fate, Sumitrás son, confess,</l>
<l>That sends me to the wilderness.</l>
<l>'Tis Fate alone that gives away</l>
<l>To other hands the royal sway.</l>
<l>How could Kaikeyí's purpose bring</l>
<l>On me this pain and suffering,</l>
<l>Were not her change of heart decreed</l>
<l>By Fate whose will commands the deed?</l>
<l>I know my filial love has been</l>
<l>The same throughout for every queen,</l>
<l>And with the same affection she</l>
<l>Has treated both her son and me.</l>
<l>Her shameful words of cruel spite</l>
<l>To stay the consecrating rite,</l>
<l>And drive me banished from the throne,—</l>
<l>These I ascribe to Fate alone,</l>
<l>How could she, born of royal race,</l>
<l>Whom nature decks with fairest grace,</l>
<l>Speak like a dame of low degree</l>
<l>Before the king to torture me?</l>
<l>But Fate, which none may comprehend,</l>
<l>To which all life must bow and bend,</l>
<l>In her and me its power has shown,</l>
<l>And all my hopes are overthrown.</l>
<l>What man, Sumitrá's darling, may</l>
<l>Contend with Fate's resistless sway,</l>
<l>Whose all-commanding power we find</l>
<l>Our former deeds alone can bind?</l>
<l>Our life and death, our joy and pain,</l>
<l>Anger and fear, and loss and gain,</l>
<l>Each thing that is, in every state,</l>
<l>All is the work of none but Fate.</l>
<l>E'en saints, inspired with rigid zeal,</l>
<l>When once the stroke of Fate they feel,</l>
<l>In sternest vows no more engage,</l>
<l>And fall enslaved by love and rage.</l>
<l>So now the sudden stroke whose weight</l>
<l>Descends unlooked for, comes of Fate,</l>
<l>And with unpitying might destroys</l>
<l>The promise of commencing joys.</l>
<l>Weigh this true counsel in thy soul:</l>
<l>With thy firm heart thy heart control;</l>
<l>Then, brother, thou wilt cease to grieve</l>
<l>For hindered rites which now I leave.</l>
<l>So cast thy needless grief away,</l>
<l>And strictly my commands obey.</l>
<l>Those preparations check with speed,</l>
<l>Nor let my throning rites proceed.</l>
<l>Those urns that stand prepared to shed</l>
<l>King-making drops upon my head,</l>

<l>And Lakshmaṇ bent his drooping head.</l>
<l>In turns by grief and pride impelled,</l>
<l>A middle course of thought he held,</l>
<l>Then in a frown of anger, bent</l>
<l>His brows that chief most excellent,</l>

<l>Breathed fierce and fast in wrath of soul.</l>
<l>His threatening brows so darkly frowned,</l>

<l>Like some infuriate lion's look.</l>

<l>O Ráma, on this treacherous deed,</l>
<l>That promised boon, so long retained,</l>
<l>He erst had given and she had gained.</l>
<l>I cannot, O my brother, bear</l>
<l>To see another throned as heir</l>
<l>With rites which all our people hate:</l>
<l>Then, O, this passion tolerate.</l>
<l>This vaunted duty which can guide</l>
<l>Thy steps from wisdom's path aside,</l>
<l>And change the counsel of thy breast,</l>
<l>O lofty-hearted, I detest.</l>
<l>Wilt thou, when power and might are thine,</l>
<l>Submit to this abhorred design?</l>
<l>Thy father's impious hest fulfil,</l>
<l>That vassal of Kaikeyí's will?</l>
<l>But if thou still wilt shut thine eyes,</l>
<l>Nor see the guile herein that lies,</l>
<l>My soul is sad, I deeply mourn,</l>
<l>And duty seems a thing to scorn.</l>
<l>Canst thou one moment think to please</l>
<l>This pair who live for love and ease,</l>
<l>And 'gainst thy peace, as foes, allied,</l>
<l>With tenderest names their hatred hide?</l>
<l>Now if thy judgment still refers</l>
<l>To Fate this plot of his and hers,</l>
<l>My mind herein can ne'er agree:</l>
<l>And O, in this be ruled by me.</l>
<l>Weak, void of manly pride are they</l>
<l>Who bend to Fate's imputed sway:</l>
<l>The choicest souls, the nobly great</l>
<l>Disdain to bow their heads to Fate.</l>
<l>And he who dares his Fate control</l>
<l>With vigorous act and manly soul,</l>
<l>Though threatening Fate his hopes assail,</l>
<l>Unmoved through all need never quail.</l>
<l>This day mankind shall learn aright</l>
<l>The power of Fate and human might,</l>
<l>So shall the gulf that lies between</l>
<l>A man and Fate be clearly seen.</l>
<l>The might of Fate subdued by me</l>
<l>This hour the citizens shall see,</l>
<l>Who saw its intervention stay</l>
<l>Thy consecrating rites to-day.</l>
<l>My power shall turn this Fate aside,</l>
<l>That threatens, as, with furious stride,</l>
<l>An elephant who scorns to feel,</l>
<l>In rage unchecked, the driver's steel.</l>
<l>Not the great Lords whose sleepless might</l>
<l>Protects the worlds, shall stay the rite</l>
<l>Though earth, hell, heaven combine their powers:</l>
<l>And shall we fear this sire of ours?</l>
<l>Then if their minds are idly bent</l>
<l>To doom thee, King, to banishment,</l>
<l>Through twice seven years of exile they</l>
<pb n="122"/><anchor id="Pg122"/>
<l>Shall in the lonely forest stay.</l>
<l>I will consume the hopes that fire</l>
<l>The queen Kaikeyí and our sire,</l>
<l>That to her son this check will bring</l>
<l>Advantage, making Bharat king.</l>
<l>The power of Fate will ne'er withstand</l>
<l>The might that arms my vigorous hand;</l>
<l>If danger and distress assail,</l>
<l>My fearless strength will still prevail.</l>
<l>A thousand circling years shall flee:</l>
<l>The forest then thy home shall be,</l>
<l>And thy good sons, succeeding, hold</l>
<l>The empire which their sire controlled.</l>
<l>The royal saints, of old who reigned,</l>
<l>For aged kings this rest ordained:</l>
<l>These to their sons their realm commit</l>
<l>That they, like sires, may cherish it.</l>
<l>O pious soul, if thou decline</l>
<l>The empire which is justly thine,</l>
<l>Lest, while the king distracted lies,</l>
<l>Disorder in the state should rise,</l>
<l>I,—or no mansion may I find</l>
<l>In worlds to hero souls assigned,—</l>
<l>The guardian of thy realm will be,</l>
<l>As the sea-bank protects the sea.</l>
<l>Then cast thine idle fears aside:</l>
<l>With prosperous rites be sanctified.</l>
<l>The lords of earth may strive in vain:</l>
<l>My power shall all their force restrain.</l>
<l>My pair of arms, my warrior's bow</l>
<l>Are not for pride or empty show:</l>
<l>For no support these shafts were made;</l>
<l>And binding up ill suits my blade:</l>
<l>To pierce the foe with deadly breach—</l>
<l>This is the work of all and each.</l>
<l>But small, methinks the love I show</l>
<l>For him I count my mortal foe.</l>
<l>Soon as my trenchant steel is bare,</l>
<l>Flashing its lightning through the air,</l>
<l>I heed no foe, nor stand aghast</l>
<l>Though Indra's self the levin cast.</l>
<l>Then shall the ways be hard to pass,</l>
<l>Where chariots lie in ruinous mass;</l>
<l>When elephant and man and steed</l>
<l>Crushed in the murderous onslaught bleed,</l>
<l>And legs and heads fall, heap on heap,</l>
<l>Beneath my sword's tremendous sweep.</l>
<l>Struck by my keen brand's trenchant blade,</l>
<l>Thine enemies shall fall dismayed,</l>
<l>Like towering mountains rent in twain,</l>
<l>Or lightning clouds that burst in rain.</l>
<l>When armed with brace and glove I stand,</l>
<l>And take my trusty bow in hand,</l>
<l>Who then shall vaunt his might? who dare</l>
<l>Count him a man to meet me there?</l>
<l>Then will I loose my shafts, and strike</l>
<l>Man, elephant, and steed alike:</l>
<l>At one shall many an arrow fly,</l>
<l>And many a foe with one shall die.</l>
<l>This day the world my power shall see,</l>
<l>That none in arms can rival me:</l>
<l>My strength the monarch shall abase,</l>
<l>And set thee, lord, in lordliest place.</l>
<l>These arms which breathe the sandal's scent,</l>
<l>Which golden bracelets ornament,</l>
<l>These hands which precious gifts bestow,</l>
<l>Which guard the friend and smite the foe,</l>
<l>A nobler service shall assay,</l>
<l>And fight in Ráma's cause to-day,</l>
<l>The robbers of thy rights to stay.</l>

<lg>
<l>So Ráma, to his purpose true,</l>
<l>To Queen Kauśalyá bade adieu,</l>
<l>Received the benison she gave,</l>
<l>And to the path of duty clave.</l>
<l>As through the crowded street he passed,</l>
<l>A radiance on the way he cast,</l>
<l>And each fair grace, by all approved,</l>
<l>The bosoms of the people moved.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now of the woeful change no word</l>
<l>The fair Videhan bride had heard;</l>
<l>The thought of that imperial rite</l>
<l>Still filled her bosom with delight.</l>
<l>With grateful heart and joyful thought</l>
<l>The Gods in worship she had sought,</l>
<l>And, well in royal duties learned,</l>
<l>Sat longing till her lord returned,</l>
<l>Not all unmarked by grief and shame</l>
<l>Within his sumptuous home he came,</l>
<l>And hurried through the happy crowd</l>
<l>With eye dejected, gloomy-browed.</l>
<l>Up Sítá sprang, and every limb</l>
<l>Trembled with fear at sight of him.</l>
<l>She marked that cheek where anguish fed,</l>
<l>Those senses care-disquieted.</l>
<l>For, when he looked on her, no more</l>
<l>Could his heart hide the load it bore,</l>
<l>Nor could the pious chief control</l>
<l>The paleness o'er his cheek that stole.</l>
<l>His altered cheer, his brow bedewed</l>
<l>With clammy drops, his grief she viewed,</l>
<l>And cried, consumed with fires of woe,</l>

<l>Vrihaspati looks down benign,</l>

<l>Why does no canopy, like foam</l>
<l>For its white beauty, shade thee home,</l>
<l>Its hundred ribs spread wide to throw</l>
<l>Splendour on thy fair head below?</l>
<l>Where are the royal fans, to grace</l>
<l>The lotus beauty of thy face,</l>
<l>Fair as the moon or wild-swan's wing,</l>
<l>And waving round the new-made king?</l>
<l>Why do no sweet-toned bards rejoice</l>
<l>To hail thee with triumphant voice?</l>
<l>No tuneful heralds love to raise</l>
<l>Loud music in their monarch's praise?</l>
<l>Why do no Bráhmans, Scripture-read,</l>
<l>Pour curds and honey on thy head,</l>
<l>Anointed, as the laws ordain,</l>
<l>With holy rites, supreme to reign?</l>
<l>Where are the chiefs of every guild?</l>
<l>Where are the myriads should have filled</l>
<l>The streets, and followed home their king</l>
<l>With merry noise and triumphing?</l>
<l>Why does no gold-wrought chariot lead</l>
<l>With four brave horses, best for speed?</l>
<l>No elephant precede the crowd</l>
<l>Like a huge hill or thunder cloud,</l>
<l>Marked from his birth for happy fate,</l>
<l>Whom signs auspicious decorate?</l>
<l>Why does no henchman, young and fair,</l>
<l>Precede thee, and delight to bear</l>
<l>Entrusted to his reverent hold</l>
<l>The burthen of thy throne of gold?</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To her, as thus she weeping cried,</l>
<l>Raghu's illustrious son replied:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Sítá, my honoured sire's decree</q></l>
<l>Commands me to the woods to flee.</l>
<l>O high-born lady, nobly bred</l>
<l>In the good paths thy footsteps tread,</l>
<l>Hear, Janak's daughter, while I tell</l>
<l>The story as it all befell.</l>
<l>Of old my father true and brave</l>
<l>Two boons to Queen Kaikeyí gave.</l>
<l>Through these the preparations made</l>
<l>For me to-day by her are stayed,</l>
<l>For he is bound to disallow</l>
<l>This promise by that earlier vow.</l>
<l>In Daṇḍak forest wild and vast</l>
<l>Must fourteen years by me be passed.</l>
<l>My father's will makes Bharat heir,</l>
<l>The kingdom and the throne to share.</l>
<l>Now, ere the lonely wild I seek,</l>
<l>I come once more with thee to speak.</l>
<l>In Bharat's presence, O my dame,</l>
<l>Ne'er speak with pride of Ráma's name:</l>
<l>Another's eulogy to hear</l>
<l>Is hateful to a monarch's ear.</l>
<l>Thou must with love his rule obey</l>
<l>To whom my father yields the sway.</l>
<l>With love and sweet observance learn</l>
<l>His grace, and more the king's, to earn.</l>
<l>Now, that my father may not break</l>
<l>The words of promise that he spake,</l>
<l>To the drear wood my steps are bent:</l>
<l>Be firm, good Sítá, and content.</l>
<l>Through all that time, my blameless spouse,</l>
<l>Keep well thy fasts and holy vows.</l>
<l>Rise from thy bed at break of day,</l>
<l>And to the Gods due worship pay.</l>
<l>With meek and lowly love revere</l>
<l>The lord of men, my father dear,</l>
<l>And reverence to Kauśalyá show,</l>
<l>My mother, worn with eld and woe:</l>
<l>By duty's law, O best of dames,</l>
<l>High worship from thy love she claims,</l>
<l>Nor to the other queens refuse</l>
<l>Observance, rendering each her dues:</l>
<l>By love and fond attention shown</l>
<l>They are my mothers like mine own.</l>
<l>Let Bharat and Śatrughna bear</l>
<l>In thy sweet love a special share:</l>
<l>Dear as my life, O let them be</l>
<l>Like brother and like son to thee.</l>
<l>In every word and deed refrain</l>
<l>From aught that Bharat's soul may pain:</l>
<l>He is Ayodhyá's king and mine,</l>
<l>The head and lord of all our line.</l>
<l>For those who serve and love them much</l>
<l>With weariless endeavour, touch</l>
<l>And win the gracious hearts of kings.</l>
<l>While wrath from disobedience springs.</l>
<l>Great monarchs from their presence send</l>
<l>Their lawful sons who still offend,</l>
<l>And welcome to the vacant place</l>
<l>Good children of an alien race.</l>
<l>Then, best of women, rest thou here,</l>
<l>And Bharat's will with love revere.</l>
<l>Obedient to thy king remain,</l>
<l>And still thy vows of truth maintain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the wide wood my steps I bend:</l>

<lg>
<l>His sweetly-speaking bride, who best</l>
<l>Deserved her lord, he thus addressed.</l>
<l>Then tender love bade passion wake,</l>
<l>And thus the fair Videhan spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What words are these that thou hast said?</q></l>
<l>Contempt of me the thought has bred.</l>
<l>O best of heroes, I dismiss</l>
<l>With bitter scorn a speech like this:</l>
<pb n="127"/><anchor id="Pg127"/>
<l>Unworthy of a warrior's fame</l>
<l>It taints a monarch's son with shame,</l>
<l>Ne'er to be heard from those who know</l>
<l>The science of the sword and bow.</l>
<l>My lord, the mother, sire, and son</l>
<l>Receive their lots by merit won;</l>
<l>The brother and the daughter find</l>
<l>The portions to their deeds assigned.</l>
<l>The wife alone, whate'er await,</l>
<l>Must share on earth her husband's fate.</l>
<l>So now the king's command which sends</l>
<l>Thee to the wild, to me extends.</l>
<l>The wife can find no refuge, none,</l>
<l>In father, mother, self, or son:</l>
<l>Both here, and when they vanish hence,</l>
<l>Her husband is her sole defence.</l>
<l>If, Raghu's son, thy steps are led</l>
<l>Where Daṇḍak's pathless wilds are spread,</l>
<l>My foot before thine own shall pass</l>
<l>Through tangled thorn and matted grass.</l>
<l>Dismiss thine anger and thy doubt:</l>
<l>Like refuse water cast them out,</l>
<l>And lead me, O my hero, hence—</l>
<l>I know not sin—with confidence.</l>
<l>Whate'er his lot, 'tis far more sweet</l>
<l>To follow still a husband's feet</l>
<l>Than in rich palaces to lie,</l>
<l>Or roam at pleasure through the sky.</l>
<l>My mother and my sire have taught</l>
<l>What duty bids, and trained each thought,</l>
<l>Nor have I now mine ear to turn</l>
<l>The duties of a wife to learn.</l>
<l>I'll seek with thee the woodland dell</l>
<l>And pathless wild where no men dwell,</l>
<l>Where tribes of silvan creatures roam,</l>
<l>And many a tiger makes his home.</l>
<l>My life shall pass as pleasant there</l>
<l>As in my father's palace fair.</l>
<l>The worlds shall wake no care in me;</l>
<l>My only care be truth to thee.</l>
<l>There while thy wish I still obey,</l>
<l>True to my vows with thee I'll stray,</l>
<l>And there shall blissful hours be spent</l>
<l>In woods with honey redolent.</l>
<l>In forest shades thy mighty arm</l>
<l>Would keep a stranger's life from harm,</l>
<l>And how shall Sítá think of fear</l>
<l>When thou, O glorious lord, art near?</l>
<l>Heir of high bliss, my choice is made,</l>
<l>Nor can I from my will be stayed.</l>
<l>Doubt not; the earth will yield me roots,</l>
<l>These will I eat, and woodland fruits;</l>
<l>And as with thee I wander there</l>
<l>I will not bring thee grief or care.</l>
<l>I long, when thou, wise lord, art nigh,</l>
<l>All fearless, with delighted eye</l>
<l>To gaze upon the rocky hill,</l>
<l>The lake, the fountain, and the rill;</l>
<l>To sport with thee, my limbs to cool,</l>
<l>In some pure lily-covered pool,</l>
<l>While the white swan's and mallard's wings</l>
<l>Are plashing in the water-springs.</l>
<l>So would a thousand seasons flee</l>
<l>Like one sweet day, if spent with thee.</l>
<l>Without my lord I would not prize</l>
<l>A home with Gods above the skies:</l>
<l>Without my lord, my life to bless,</l>
<l>Where could be heaven or happiness?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forbid me not: with thee I go</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">The tangled wood to tread.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There will I live with thee, as though</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">This roof were o'er my head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My will for thine shall be resigned;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Thy feet my steps shall guide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou, only thou, art in my mind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">I heed not all beside.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy heart shall ne'er by me be grieved;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Do not my prayer deny:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Take me, dear lord; of thee bereaved</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4"><q rend="post">Thy Sítá swears to die.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These words the duteous lady spake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Nor would he yet consent</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His faithful wife with him to take</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">To share his banishment.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He soothed her with his gentle speech;</l>

<lg>
<l>Thus Sítá spake, and he who knew</l>
<l>His duty, to its orders true,</l>
<l>Was still reluctant as the woes</l>
<l>Of forest life before him rose.</l>
<l>He sought to soothe her grief, to dry</l>
<l>The torrent from each brimming eye,</l>
<l>And then, her firm resolve to shake,</l>
<l>These words the pious hero spake:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">O daughter of a noble line,</q></l>

<l>Each danger in the wood, each pain.</l>
<l>Thy lips have spoken: I condemn</l>

<l>And forth his voice of terror throws:</l>

<l>'Tis hard to ford each treacherous flood,</l>
<l>So thick with crocodiles and mud,</l>
<l>Where the wild elephants repose:</l>
<l>The wood, my love, is full of woes.</l>
<l>Or far from streams the wanderer strays</l>
<l>Through thorns and creeper-tangled ways,</l>
<l>While round him many a wild-cock crows:</l>
<l>The wood, my love, is full of woes.</l>
<l>On the cold ground upon a heap</l>
<l>Of gathered leaves condemned to sleep,</l>
<l>Toil-wearied, will his eyelids close:</l>

<l>Long days and nights must he content</l>
<l>His soul with scanty aliment,</l>
<l>What fruit the wind from branches blows:</l>

<l>O Sítá, while his strength may last,</l>
<l>The ascetic in the wood must fast,</l>
<l>Coil on his head his matted hair,</l>

<l>The snakes that by the rives hide</l>
<l>In sinuous course like rivers glide,</l>

<l>The wood, my love, is full of woes.</l>
<l>Trees, thorny bushes, intertwined,</l>

<l>Thus Ráma spake. Her lord's address</l>
<l>The lady heard with deep distress,</l>
<l>And, as the tear bedimmed her eye,</l>
<l>In soft low accents made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The perils of the wood, and all</q></l>
<l>The woes thou countest to appal,</l>
<l>Led by my love I deem not pain;</l>
<l>Each woe a charm, each loss a gain.</l>
<l>Tiger, and elephant, and deer,</l>
<l>Bull, lion, buffalo, in fear,</l>
<l>Soon as thy matchless form they see,</l>
<l>With every silvan beast will flee.</l>
<l>With thee, O Ráma, I must go:</l>
<l>My sire's command ordains it so.</l>
<l>Bereft of thee, my lonely heart</l>
<l>Must break, and life and I must part.</l>
<l>While thou, O mighty lord, art nigh,</l>
<l>Not even He who rules the sky,</l>
<l>Though He is strongest of the strong,</l>
<l>With all his might can do me wrong.</l>
<l>Nor can a lonely woman left</l>
<l>By her dear husband live bereft.</l>
<l>In my great love, my lord, I ween,</l>
<l>The truth of this thou mayst have seen.</l>
<l>In my sire's palace long ago</l>
<l>I heard the chief of those who know,</l>
<l>The truth-declaring Bráhmans, tell</l>
<l>My fortune, in the wood to dwell.</l>
<l>I heard their promise who divine</l>
<l>The future by each mark and sign,</l>
<l>And from that hour have longed to lead</l>
<l>The forest life their lips decreed.</l>
<l>Now, mighty Ráma, I must share</l>
<l>Thy father's doom which sends thee there;</l>
<l>In this I will not be denied,</l>
<l>But follow, love, where thou shalt guide.</l>
<l>O husband, I will go with thee,</l>
<l>Obedient to that high decree.</l>
<l>Now let the Bráhmans' words be true,</l>
<l>For this the time they had in view.</l>
<l>I know full well the wood has woes;</l>
<l>But they disturb the lives of those</l>
<l>Who in the forest dwell, nor hold</l>
<l>Their rebel senses well controlled.</l>
<pb n="129"/><anchor id="Pg129"/>
<l>In my sire's halls, ere I was wed,</l>
<l>I heard a dame who begged her bread</l>
<l>Before my mother's face relate</l>
<l>What griefs a forest life await.</l>
<l>And many a time in sport I prayed</l>
<l>To seek with thee the greenwood shade,</l>
<l>For O, my heart on this is set,</l>
<l>To follow thee, dear anchoret.</l>
<l>May blessings on thy life attend:</l>

<l>Love from all sin my soul will free:</l>
<l>My husband is a God to me.</l>
<l>So, love, with thee shall I have bliss</l>
<l>And share the life that follows this.</l>
<l>I heard a Bráhman, dear to fame,</l>
<l>This ancient Scripture text proclaim:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The woman whom on earth below</q></l>
<l>Her parents on a man bestow,</l>
<l>And lawfully their hands unite</l>
<l>With water and each holy rite,</l>

<l><q rend="post">His also in the after life.</q></l>
<l>Then tell me, O beloved, why</l>
<l>Thou wilt this earnest prayer deny,</l>
<l>Nor take me with thee to the wood,</l>
<l>Thine own dear wife so true and good.</l>
<l>But if thou wilt not take me there</l>
<l>Thus grieving in my wild despair,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">So thus to share his exile, she</l>
<l>Besought him with each earnest plea,</l>
<l>Nor could she yet her lord persuade</l>

<l>Not e'en in fancy can I brook</l>
<l>To any guard save thee to look:</l>
<l>Let meaner wives their houses shame,</l>
<l>To go with thee is all my claim.</l>
<l>Like some low actor, deemst thou fit</l>
<l>Thy wife to others to commit—</l>
<l>Thine own, espoused in maiden youth,</l>
<l>Thy wife so long, unblamed for truth?</l>
<l>Do thou, my lord, his will obey</l>
<l>For whom thou losest royal sway,</l>
<l>To whom thou wouldst thy wife confide—</l>
<l>Not me, but thee, his wish may guide.</l>
<l>Thou must not here thy wife forsake,</l>
<l>And to the wood thy journey make,</l>
<l>Whether stern penance, grief, and care,</l>
<l>Or rule or heaven await thee there.</l>
<l>Nor shall fatigue my limbs distress</l>
<l>When wandering in the wilderness:</l>
<l>Each path which near to thee I tread</l>
<l>Shall seem a soft luxurious bed.</l>
<l>The reeds, the bushes where I pass,</l>
<l>The thorny trees, the tangled grass</l>
<l>Shall feel, if only thou be near,</l>
<l>Soft to my touch as skins of deer.</l>
<l>When the rude wind in fury blows,</l>
<l>And scattered dust upon me throws,</l>
<l>That dust, beloved lord, to me</l>
<l>Shall as the precious sandal be.</l>
<l>And what shall be more blest than I,</l>
<l>When gazing on the wood I lie</l>
<l>In some green glade upon a bed</l>
<l>With sacred grass beneath us spread?</l>
<l>The root, the leaf, the fruit which thou</l>
<l>Shalt give me from the earth or bough,</l>
<l>Scanty or plentiful, to eat,</l>
<l>Shall taste to me as Amrit sweet.</l>
<l>As there I live on flowers and roots</l>
<l>And every season's kindly fruits,</l>
<l>I will not for my mother grieve,</l>
<l>My sire, my home, or all I leave.</l>
<l>My presence, love, shall never add</l>
<l>One pain to make the heart more sad;</l>
<pb n="130"/><anchor id="Pg130"/>
<l>I will not cause thee grief or care,</l>
<l>Nor be a burden hard to bear.</l>
<l>With thee is heaven, where'er the spot;</l>
<l>Each place is hell where thou art not.</l>
<l>Then go with me, O Ráma; this</l>
<l>Is all my hope and all my bliss.</l>
<l>If thou wilt leave thy wife who still</l>
<l>Entreats thee with undaunted will,</l>
<l>This very day shall poison close</l>
<l>The life that spurns the rule of foes.</l>
<l>How, after, can my soul sustain</l>
<l>The bitter life of endless pain,</l>
<l>When thy dear face, my lord, I miss?</l>
<l>No, death is better far than this.</l>
<l>Not for an hour could I endure</l>
<l>The deadly grief that knows not cure,</l>
<l>Far less a woe I could not shun</l>
<l><q rend="post">For ten long years, and three, and one.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While fires of woe consumed her, such</l>
<l>Her sad appeal, lamenting much;</l>
<l>Then with a wild cry, anguish-wrung,</l>
<l>About her husband's neck she clung.</l>
<l>Like some she-elephant who bleeds</l>
<l>Struck by the hunter's venomed reeds,</l>
<l>So in her quivering heart she felt</l>
<l>The many wounds his speeches dealt.</l>
<l>Then, as the spark from wood is gained,<note place="foot">Fire for sacrificial
purposes is produced by the attrition of two pieces of wood.</note></l>
<l>Down rolled the tear so long restrained:</l>
<l>The crystal moisture, sprung from woe,</l>
<l>From her sweet eyes began to flow,</l>
<l>As runs the water from a pair</l>
<l>Of lotuses divinely fair.</l>
<l>And Sítá's face with long dark eyes,</l>
<l>Pure as the moon of autumn skies,</l>
<l>Faded with weeping, as the buds</l>
<l>Of lotuses when sink the floods.</l>
<l>Around his wife his arms he strained,</l>
<l>Who senseless from her woe remained,</l>
<l>And with sweet words, that bade her wake</l>
<l>To life again, the hero spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I would not with thy woe, my Queen,</q></l>
<l>Buy heaven and all its blissful sheen.</l>
<l>Void of all fear am I as He,</l>
<l>The self-existent God, can be.</l>
<l>I knew not all thy heart till now,</l>
<l>Dear lady of the lovely brow,</l>
<l>So wished not thee in woods to dwell;</l>
<l>Yet there mine arm can guard thee well.</l>
<l>Now surely thou, dear love, wast made</l>
<l>To dwell with me in green wood shade.</l>
<l>And, as a high saint's tender mind</l>
<l>Clings to its love for all mankind,</l>
<l>So I to thee will ever cling,</l>
<l>Sweet daughter of Videha's king.</l>
<l>The good, of old, O soft of frame,</l>
<l>Honoured this duty's sovereign claim,</l>
<l>And I its guidance will not shun,</l>
<l>True as light's Queen is to the Sun.</l>
<l>I cannot, pride of Janak's line,</l>
<l>This journey to the wood decline:</l>
<l>My sire's behest, the oath he sware,</l>
<l>The claims of truth, all lead me there.</l>
<l>One duty, dear the same for aye,</l>
<l>Is sire and mother to obey:</l>
<l>Should I their orders once transgress</l>
<l>My very life were weariness.</l>
<l>If glad obedience be denied</l>
<l>To father, mother, holy guide,</l>
<l>What rites, what service can be done</l>
<l>That stern Fate's favour may be won?</l>
<l>These three the triple world comprise,</l>
<l>O darling of the lovely eyes.</l>
<l>Earth has no holy thing like these</l>
<l>Whom with all love men seek to please.</l>
<l>Not truth, or gift, or bended knee,</l>
<l>Not honour, worship, lordly fee,</l>
<l>Storms heaven and wins a blessing thence</l>
<l>Like sonly love and reverence.</l>
<l>Heaven, riches, grain, and varied lore,</l>
<l>With sons and many a blessing more,</l>
<l>All these are made their own with ease</l>
<l>By those their elders' souls who please.</l>
<l>The mighty-souled, who ne'er forget,</l>
<l>Devoted sons, their filial debt,</l>
<l>Win worlds where Gods and minstrels are,</l>
<l>And Brahmá's sphere more glorious far.</l>
<l>Now as the orders of my sire,</l>
<l>Who keeps the way of truth, require,</l>
<l>So will I do, for such the way</l>
<l>Of duty that endures for aye:</l>
<l>To take thee, love, to Daṇḍak's wild</l>
<l>My heart at length is reconciled,</l>
<l>For thee such earnest thoughts impel</l>
<l>To follow, and with me to dwell.</l>
<l>O faultless form from feet to brows,</l>
<l>Come with me, as my will allows,</l>
<l>And duty there with me pursue,</l>
<l>Trembler, whose bright eyes thrill me through.</l>
<l>In all thy days, come good come ill,</l>
<l>Preserve unchanged such noble will,</l>
<l>And thou, dear love, wilt ever be</l>
<l>The glory of thy house and me.</l>
<l>Now, beauteous-armed, begin the tasks</l>
<l>The woodland life of hermits asks.</l>
<l>For me the joys of heaven above</l>
<l>Have charms no more without thee, love.</l>
<l>And now, dear Sítá, be not slow:</l>
<l>Food on good mendicants bestow,</l>
<l>And for the holy Bráhmans bring</l>
<l>Thy treasures and each precious thing.</l>
<l>Thy best attire and gems collect,</l>

<head>Canto XXXI. Lakshman's Prayer.</head>

<lg>
<l>When Lakshmaṇ, who had joined them there,</l>
<l>Had heard the converse of the pair,</l>
<l>His mien was changed, his eyes o'erflowed,</l>
<l>His breast no more could bear its load.</l>
<l>The son of Raghu, sore distressed,</l>
<l>His brother's feet with fervour pressed,</l>
<l>While thus to Sítá he complained,</l>
<l>And him by lofty vows enchained:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">If thou wilt make the woods thy home,</q></l>
<l>Where elephant and roebuck roam,</l>
<l>I too this day will take my bow</l>
<l>And in the path before thee go.</l>
<l>Our way will lie through forest ground</l>
<l>Where countless birds and beasts are found,</l>
<l>I heed not homes of Gods on high,</l>
<l>I heed not life that cannot die,</l>
<l>Nor would I wish, with thee away,</l>
<l><q rend="post">O'er the three worlds to stretch my sway.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Lakshmaṇ spake, with earnest prayer</l>
<l>His brother's woodland life to share.</l>
<l>As Ráma still his prayer denied</l>
<l>With soothing words, again he cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">When leave at first thou didst accord,</q></l>
<l>Why dost thou stay me now, my lord?</l>
<l>Thou art my refuge: O, be kind,</l>
<l>Leave me not, dear my lord, behind.</l>
<l>Thou canst not, brother, if thou choose</l>
<l><q rend="post">That I still live, my wish refuse.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glorious chief his speech renewed</l>
<l>To faithful Lakshmaṇ as he sued,</l>
<l>And on the eyes of Ráma gazed</l>
<l>Longing to lead, with hands upraised:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thou art a hero just and dear,</q></l>
<l>Whose steps to virtue's path adhere,</l>
<l>Loved as my life till life shall end,</l>
<l>My faithful brother and my friend.</l>
<l>If to the woods thou take thy way</l>
<l>With Sítá and with me to-day,</l>
<l>Who for Kauśalyá will provide,</l>
<l>And guard the good Sumitrá's side?</l>
<l>The lord of earth, of mighty power,</l>
<l>Who sends good things in plenteous shower,</l>
<l>As Indra pours the grateful rain,</l>
<l>A captive lies in passion's chain.</l>
<l>The power imperial for her son</l>
<l>Has Aśvapati's daughter<note place="foot">Kaikeyí.</note> won,</l>
<l>And she, proud queen, will little heed</l>
<l>Her miserable rivals' need.</l>
<l>So Bharat, ruler of the land,</l>
<l>By Queen Kaikeyí's side will stand,</l>
<l>Nor of those two will ever think,</l>
<l>While grieving in despair they sink.</l>
<l>Now, Lakshmaṇ, as thy love decrees,</l>
<l>Or else the monarch's heart to please,</l>
<l>Follow this counsel and protect</l>
<l>My honoured mother from neglect.</l>
<l>So thou, while not to me alone</l>
<l>Thy great affection will be shown,</l>
<l>To highest duty wilt adhere</l>
<l>By serving those thou shouldst revere.</l>
<l>Now, son of Raghu, for my sake</l>
<l>Obey this one request I make,</l>
<l>Or, of her darling son bereft,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Kauśalyá has no comfort left.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The faithful Lakshmaṇ, thus addressed</l>
<l>In gentle words which love expressed,</l>
<l>To him in lore of language learned,</l>
<l>His answer, eloquent, returned:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Nay, through thy might each queen will
share</q></l>
<l>Attentive Bharat's love and care,</l>
<l>Should Bharat, raised as king to sway</l>
<l>This noblest realm, his trust betray,</l>
<l>Nor for their safety well provide,</l>
<l>Seduced by ill-suggesting pride,</l>
<l>Doubt not my vengeful hand shall kill</l>
<l>The cruel wretch who counsels ill—</l>
<l>Kill him and all who lend him aid,</l>
<l>And the three worlds in league arrayed.</l>
<l>And good Kauśalyá well can fee</l>
<l>A thousand champions like to me.</l>
<l>A thousand hamlets rich in grain</l>
<l>The station of that queen maintain.</l>
<l>She may, and my dear mother too,</l>
<l>Live on the ample revenue.</l>
<l>Then let me follow thee: herein:</l>
<l>Is naught that may resemble sin.</l>
<l>So shall I in my wish succeed,</l>
<l>And aid, perhaps, my brother's need.</l>
<l>My bow and quiver well supplied</l>
<l>With arrows hanging at my side,</l>
<l>My hands shall spade and basket bear,</l>
<l>And for thy feet the way prepare.</l>
<l>I'll bring thee roots and berries sweet.</l>
<l>And woodland fare which hermits eat.</l>
<l>Thou shall with thy Videhan spouse</l>
<l>Recline upon the mountain's brows;</l>
<l>Be mine the toil, be mine to keep</l>
<l><q rend="post">Watch o'er thee waking or asleep.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Filled by his speech with joy and pride,</l>
<l>Ráma to Lakshmaṇ thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Go then, my brother, bid adieu</q></l>
<l>To all thy friends and retinue.</l>
<l>And those two bows of fearful might,</l>
<l>Celestial, which, at that famed rite,</l>
<l>Lord Varuṇ gave to Janak, king</l>
<l>Of fair Vedeha with thee bring,</l>
<l>With heavenly coats of sword-proof mail,</l>
<l>Quivers, whose arrows never fail,</l>
<pb n="132"/><anchor id="Pg132"/>
<l>And golden-hilted swords so keen,</l>
<l>The rivals of the sun in sheen.</l>
<l>Tended with care these arms are all</l>
<l>Preserved in my preceptor's hall.</l>
<l>With speed, O Lakshmaṇ, go, produce,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And bring them hither for our use.</q></l>
<l>So on a woodland life intent,</l>
<l>To see his faithful friends he went,</l>
<l>And brought the heavenly arms which lay</l>
<l>By Ráma's teacher stored away.</l>
<l>And Raghu's son to Ráma showed</l>
<l>Those wondrous arms which gleamed and glowed,</l>
<l>Well kept, adorned with many a wreath</l>
<l>Of flowers on case, and hilt, and sheath.</l>
<l>The prudent Ráma at the sight</l>
<l>Addressed his brother with delight:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Well art thou come, my brother dear,</q></l>
<l>For much I longed to see thee here.</l>
<l>For with thine aid, before I go,</l>
<l>I would my gold and wealth bestow</l>
<l>Upon the Bráhmans sage, who school</l>
<l>Their lives by stern devotion's rule.</l>
<l>And for all those who ever dwell</l>
<l>Within my house and serve me well,</l>
<l>Devoted servants, true and good,</l>
<l>Will I provide a livelihood.</l>

<lg>
<l>That speech so noble which conveyed</l>
<l>His friendly wish, the chief obeyed,</l>
<l>With steps made swift by anxious thought</l>
<l>The wise Suyajǹa's home he sought.</l>
<l>Him in the hall of Fire<note place="foot">The chapel where the sacred fire used
in worship is kept.</note> he found,</l>
<l>And bent before him to the ground:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O friend, to Ráma's house return,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Who now performs a task most stern.</q></l>
<l>He, when his noonday rites were done,</l>
<l>Went forth with fair Sumitrá's son,</l>
<l>And came to Ráma's bright abode</l>
<l>Rich in the love which Lakshmí showed.</l>
<l>The son of Raghu, with his dame,</l>
<l>With joined hands met him as he came,</l>
<l>Showing to him who Scripture knew</l>
<l>The worship that is Agni's due.</l>
<l>With armlets, bracelets, collars, rings,</l>
<l>With costly pearls on golden strings,</l>
<l>With many a gem for neck and limb</l>
<l>The son of Raghu honoured him.</l>
<l>Then Ráma, at his wife's request,</l>
<l>The wise Suyajǹa thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Accept a necklace too to deck</q></l>
<l>With golden strings thy spouse's neck.</l>
<l>And Sítá here, my friend, were glad</l>
<l>A girdle to her gift to add.</l>
<l>And many a bracelet wrought with care,</l>
<l>And many an armlet rich and rare,</l>
<l>My wife to thine is fain to give,</l>
<l>Departing in the wood to live.</l>
<l>A bed by skilful workmen made,</l>
<l>With gold and various gems inlaid—</l>
<l>This too, before she goes, would she</l>
<l>Present, O saintly friend, to thee.</l>
<l>Thine be my elephant, so famed,</l>
<l>My uncle's present, Victor named;</l>
<l>And let a thousand coins of gold,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Great Bráhman, with the gift be told.</q></l>
<l>Thus Ráma spoke: nor he declined</l>
<l>The noble gifts for him designed.</l>
<l>On Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, Sítá he</l>
<l>Invoked all high felicity.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In pleasant words then Ráma gave</l>

<l>Chief of the Taittiríya sect<note place="foot">The students and teachers

<l>Until the sage be satisfied.</l>
<l>On Chitraratha, true and dear,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Raghu's son addressed the crowd</l>

<l>The prince of men with Lakshmaṇ's aid</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A Bráhman, long in evil case,</l>

<l>Cast from his hand it flew, and sank</l>
<l>To earth on Sarjú's farther bank,</l>
<l>Where herds of kine in thousands fed</l>
<l>Near to the well-stocked bullock shed.</l>
<l>And all the cows that wandered o'er</l>
<l>The meadow, far as Sarjú's shore,</l>
<l>At Ráma's word the herdsmen drove</l>
<l>To Trijaṭ's cottage in the grove.</l>
<l>He drew the Bráhman to his breast,</l>
<l>And thus with calming words addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now be not angry, Sire. I pray:</q></l>
<l>This jest of mine was meant in play.</l>
<l>These thousand kine, but not alone.</l>

<lg>
<l>Thus Sítá and the princes brave</l>
<l>Much wealth to all the Bráhmans gave.</l>
<l>Then to the monarch's house the three</l>
<l>Went forth the aged king to see.</l>
<l>The princes from two servants took</l>
<l>Those heavenly arms of glorious look,</l>
<l>Adorned with garland and with band</l>
<l>By Sítá's beautifying hand.</l>
<l>On each high house a mournful throng</l>
<l>Had gathered ere they passed along,</l>
<l>Who gazed in pure unselfish woe</l>
<l>From turret, roof, and portico.</l>
<l>So dense the crowd that blocked the ways,</l>
<l>The rest, unable there to gaze,</l>
<l>Were fain each terrace to ascend,</l>
<l>And thence their eyes on Ráma bend.</l>
<l>Then as the gathered multitude</l>
<l>On foot their well-loved Ráma viewed,</l>
<l>No royal shade to screen his head,</l>
<l>Such words, disturbed in grief, they said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O look, our hero, wont to ride</q></l>
<l>Leading a host in perfect pride—</l>
<l>Now Lakshmaṇ, sole of all his friends,</l>
<l>With Sítá on his steps attends.</l>
<l>Though he has known the sweets of power,</l>
<l>And poured his gifts in liberal shower,</l>
<l>From duty's path he will not swerve,</l>
<pb n="134"/><anchor id="Pg134"/>
<l>But, still his father's truth preserve.</l>
<l>And she whose form so soft and fair</l>
<l>Was veiled from spirits of the air,</l>
<l>Now walks unsheltered from the day,</l>
<l>Seen by the crowds who throng the way.</l>
<l>Ah, for that gently-nurtured form!</l>
<l>How will it fade with sun and storm!</l>
<l>How will the rain, the cold, the heat</l>
<l>Mar fragrant breast and tinted feet!</l>
<l>Surely some demon has possessed</l>
<l>His sire, and speaks within his breast,</l>
<l>Or how could one that is a king</l>
<l>Thus send his dear son wandering?</l>
<l>It were a deed unkindly done</l>
<l>To banish e'en a worthless son:</l>
<l>But what, when his pure life has gained</l>
<l>The hearts of all, by love enchained?</l>
<l>Six sovereign virtues join to grace</l>
<l>Ráma the foremost of his race:</l>
<l>Tender and kind and pure is he,</l>
<l>Docile, religious, passion-free.</l>
<l>Hence misery strikes not him alone:</l>
<l>In bitterest grief the people moan,</l>
<l>Like creatures of the stream, when dry</l>
<l>In the great heat the channels lie.</l>
<l>The world is mournful with the grief</l>
<l>That falls on its beloved chief,</l>
<l>As, when the root is hewn away,</l>
<l>Tree, fruit, and flower, and bud decay.</l>
<l>The soul of duty, bright to see,</l>
<l>He is the root of you and me;</l>
<l>And all of us, who share his grief,</l>
<l>His branches, blossom, fruit, and leaf.</l>
<l>Now like the faithful Lakshmaṇ, we</l>
<l>Will follow and be true as he;</l>
<l>Our wives and kinsmen call with speed,</l>
<l>And hasten where our lord shall lead.</l>
<l>Yes, we will leave each well-loved spot,</l>
<l>The field, the garden, and the cot,</l>
<l>And, sharers of his weal and woe,</l>
<l>Behind the pious Ráma go.</l>
<l>Our houses, empty of their stores,</l>
<l>With ruined courts and broken doors,</l>
<l>With all their treasures borne away.</l>
<l>And gear that made them bright and gay:</l>
<l>O'errun by rats, with dust o'erspread,</l>
<l>Shrines, whence the deities have fled,</l>
<l>Where not a hand the water pours,</l>
<l>Or sweeps the long-neglected floors,</l>
<l>No incense loads the evening air,</l>
<l>No Bráhmans chant the text and prayer,</l>
<l>No fire of sacrifice is bright,</l>
<l>No gift is known, no sacred rite;</l>
<l>With floors which broken vessels strew,</l>
<l>As if our woes had crushed them too—</l>
<l>Of these be stern Kaikeyí queen,</l>
<l>And rule o'er homes where we have been.</l>
<l>The wood where Ráma's feet may roam</l>
<l>Shall be our city and our home,</l>
<l>And this fair city we forsake,</l>
<l>Our flight a wilderness shall make.</l>
<l>Each serpent from his hole shall hie,</l>
<l>The birds and beasts from mountain fly,</l>
<l>Lions and elephants in fear</l>
<l>Shall quit the woods when we come near,</l>
<l>Yield the broad wilds for us to range,</l>
<l>And take our city in exchange.</l>
<l>With Ráma will we hence, content</l>
<l><q rend="post">If, where he is, our days be spent.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such were the varied words the crowd</l>
<l>Of all conditions spoke aloud.</l>
<l>And Ráma heard their speeches, yet</l>
<l>Changed not his purpose firmly set.</l>
<l>His father's palace soon he neared,</l>
<l>That like Kailása's hill appeared.</l>
<l>Like a wild elephant he strode</l>
<l>Right onward to the bright abode.</l>
<l>Within the palace court he stepped,</l>

<l>The dark incomparable chief</l>

<l><q>Go tell my sire that I am here.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sumantra, sad and all dismayed,</l>
<l>The chieftain's order swift obeyed.</l>
<l>Within the palace doors he hied</l>
<l>And saw the king, who wept and sighed.</l>
<l>Like the great sun when wrapped in shade</l>
<l>Like fire by ashes overlaid,</l>
<l>Or like a pool with waters dried,</l>
<l>So lay the world's great lord and pride,</l>
<l>A while the wise Sumantra gazed</l>
<l>On him whose senses woe has dazed,</l>
<l>Grieving for Ráma. Near he drew</l>
<l>With hands upraised in reverence due.</l>
<l>With blessing first his king he hailed;</l>
<l>Then with a voice that well-nigh failed,</l>
<l>In trembling accents soft and low</l>
<l>Addressed the monarch in his woe:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The prince of men, thy Ráma, waits</q></l>
<l>Before thee at the palace gates.</l>
<l>His wealth to Bráhmans he has dealt,</l>
<l>And all who in his home have dwelt.</l>
<l>Admit thy son. His friends have heard</l>
<l>His kind farewell and parting word,</l>
<l>He longs to see thee first, and then</l>
<l>Will seek the wilds, O King of men.</l>
<l>He, with each princely virtue's blaze,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Shines as the sun engirt by rays.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The truthful King who loved to keep</l>
<l>The law profound as Ocean's deep,</l>
<l>And stainless as the dark blue sky,</l>
<l>Thus to Sumantra made reply:</l>
<pb n="135"/><anchor id="Pg135"/>
<l><q rend="pre">Go then, Sumantra, go and call</q></l>
<l>My wives and ladies one and all.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Quick to the inner rooms he sped,</l>
<l>And thus to all the women said,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Come, at the summons of the king:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Come all, and make no tarrying.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their husband's word, by him conveyed,</l>
<l>Soon as they heard, the dames obeyed,</l>
<l>And following his guidance all</l>
<l>Came thronging to the regal hall.</l>
<l>In number half seven hundred, they,</l>
<l>All lovely dames, in long array,</l>
<l>With their bright eyes for weeping red,</l>
<l>To stand round Queen Kauśalyá, sped.</l>
<l>They gathered, and the monarch viewed</l>
<l>One moment all the multitude,</l>
<l>Then to Sumantra spoke and said:</l>
<l><q>Now let my son be hither led.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sumantra went. Then Ráma came,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ, and the Maithil dame,</l>
<l>And, as he led them on, their guide</l>
<l>Straight to the monarch's presence hied.</l>
<l>When yet far off the father saw</l>
<l>His son with raised palms toward him draw,</l>
<l>Girt by his ladies, sick with woes,</l>
<l>Swift from his royal seat he rose.</l>
<l>With all his strength the aged man</l>
<l>To meet his darling Ráma ran,</l>
<l>But trembling, wild with dark despair,</l>
<l>Fell on the ground and fainted there.</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ, wont in cars to ride,</l>
<l>And Ráma, threw them by the side</l>
<l>Of the poor miserable king,</l>
<l>Half lifeless with his sorrow's sting.</l>
<l>Throughout the spacious hall up went</l>
<l>A thousand women's wild lament:</l>
<l><q>Ah Ráma!</q> thus they wailed and wept,</l>
<l>And anklets tinkled as they stepped</l>
<l>Around his body, weeping, threw</l>
<l>Their loving arms the brothers two,</l>
<l>And then, with Sítá's gentle aid,</l>
<l>The king upon a couch was laid.</l>
<l>At length to earth's imperial lord,</l>
<l>When life and knowledge were restored,</l>
<l>Though seas of woe went o'er his head,</l>
<l>With suppliant hand, thus Ráma said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Lord of us all, great King, thou art:</q></l>
<l>Bid me farewell before we part,</l>
<l>To Daṇḍak wood this day I go:</l>
<l>One blessing and one look bestow.</l>
<l>Let Lakshmaṇ my companion be,</l>
<l>And Sítá also follow me.</l>
<l>With truthful pleas I sought to bend</l>
<l>Their purpose; but no ear they lend.</l>
<l>Now cast this sorrow from thy heart,</l>
<l>And let us all, great King, depart.</l>
<l>As Brahmá sends his children, so</l>
<l><q rend="post">Let Lakshmaṇ, me, and Sítá go.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stood unmoved, and watched intent</l>
<l>Until the king should grant consent.</l>
<l>Upon his son his eyes he cast,</l>
<l>And thus the monarch spake at last:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Ráma, by her arts enslaved,</q></l>
<l>I gave the boons Kaikeyí craved,</l>
<l>Unfit to reign, by her misled:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Be ruler in thy father's stead.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by the lord of men addressed,</l>
<l>Ráma, of virtue's friends the best,</l>
<l>In lore of language duly learned,</l>
<l>His answer, reverent, thus returned:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">A thousand years, O King, remain</q></l>
<l>O'er this our city still to reign.</l>
<l>I in the woods my life will lead:</l>
<l>The lust of rule no more I heed.</l>
<l>Nine years and five I there will spend,</l>
<l>And when the portioned days shall end,</l>
<l>Will come, my vows and exile o'er,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And clasp thy feet, my King, once more.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A captive in the snare of truth,</l>
<l>Weeping, distressed with woe and ruth,</l>
<l>Thus spake the monarch, while the queen</l>
<l>Kaikeyí urged him on unseen:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Go then, O Ráma, and begin</q></l>
<l>Thy course unvext by fear and sin:</l>
<l>Go, my beloved son, and earn</l>
<l>Success, and joy, and safe return.</l>
<l>So fast the bonds of duty bind.</l>
<l>O Raghu's son, thy truthful mind,</l>
<l>That naught can turn thee back, or guide</l>
<l>Thy will so strongly fortified.</l>
<l>But O, a little longer stay,</l>
<l>Nor turn thy steps this night away,</l>
<l>That I one little day-—alas!</l>
<l>One only—-with my son may pass.</l>
<l>Me and thy mother do not slight,</l>
<l>But stay, my son, with me to-night;</l>
<l>With every dainty please thy taste,</l>
<l>And seek to-morrow morn the waste.</l>
<l>Hard is thy task, O Raghu's son,</l>
<l>Dire is the toil thou wilt not shun,</l>
<l>Far to the lonely wood to flee,</l>
<l>And leave thy friends for love of me.</l>
<l>I swear it by my truth, believe,</l>
<l>For thee, my son, I deeply grieve,</l>
<l>Misguided by the traitress dame</l>
<l>With hidden guile like smouldering flame.</l>
<l>Now, by her wicked counsel stirred,</l>
<l>Thou fain wouldst keep my plighted word.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma having calmly heard</l>
<l>His wretched father speak each word,</l>

<l>To-morrow must those dainties fail.</l>
<l>This day departure I prefer</l>
<l>To all that wealth can minister.</l>

<pb n="136"/><anchor id="Pg136"/>
<l>Her multitudes of men, her grain,</l>
<l>Her stores of wealth, let Bharat reign.</l>
<l>And let the promised boon which thou</l>
<l>Wast pleased to grant the queen ere now,</l>
<l>Be hers in full. Be true, O King,</l>
<l>Kind giver of each precious thing.</l>
<l>Thy spoken word I still will heed,</l>
<l>Obeying all thy lips decreed:</l>
<l>And fourteen years in woods will dwell</l>
<l>With those who live in glade and dell.</l>
<l>No hopes of power my heart can touch,</l>
<l>No selfish joys attract so much</l>
<l>As son of Raghu, to fulfil</l>
<l>With heart and soul my father's will.</l>
<l>Dismiss, dismiss thy needless woe,</l>
<l>Nor let those drowning torrents flow:</l>
<l>The Lord of Rivers in his pride</l>
<l>Keeps to the banks that bar his tide.</l>
<l>Here in thy presence I declare;</l>
<l>By thy good deeds, thy truth, I swear;</l>
<l>Nor lordship, joy, nor lands I prize;</l>
<l>Life, heaven, all blessings I despise.</l>
<l>I wish to see thee still remain</l>
<l>Most true, O King, and free from stain.</l>
<l>It must not, Sire, it must not be:</l>
<l>I cannot rest one hour with thee.</l>
<l>Then bring this sorrow to an end,</l>
<l>For naught my settled will can bend.</l>
<l>I gave a pledge that binds me too,</l>
<l>And to that pledge I still am true.</l>
<l>Kaikeyí bade me speed away:</l>
<l>She prayed me, and I answered yea.</l>
<l>Pine not for me, and weep no more;</l>
<l>The wood for us has joy in store,</l>
<l>Filled with the wild deer's peaceful herds</l>

<l>A father is the God of each,</l>

<l>And to thine eyes thy son restore:</l>
<l>Be comforted, and weep no more.</l>

<lg>
<l>Wild with the rage he could not calm,</l>
<l>Sumantra, grinding palm on palm,</l>
<l>His head in quick impatience shook,</l>
<l>And sighed with woe he could not brook.</l>
<l>He gnashed his teeth, his eyes were red,</l>
<l>From his changed face the colour fled.</l>
<l>In rage and grief that knew no law,</l>
<l>The temper of the king he saw.</l>
<l>With his word-arrows swift and keen</l>
<l>He shook the bosom of the queen.</l>
<l>With scorn, as though its lightning stroke</l>
<l>Would blast her body, thus he spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thou, who, of no dread sin afraid,</q></l>

<l>Each thing that moves or fixed remains,</l>

<l>Despise not Daśaratha, he</l>

<l>A loving wife in worth outruns</l>

<l>Kings, when their sires have passed away,</l>
<l>Succeed by birthright to the sway.</l>
<l>Ikshváku's son still rules the state,</l>
<l>Yet thou this rule wouldst violate.</l>
<l>Yea, let thy son, Kaikeyí, reign,</l>
<l>Let Bharat rule his sire's domain.</l>
<l>Thy will, O Queen, shall none oppose:</l>
<l>We all will go where Ráma goes.</l>
<l>No Bráhman, scorning thee, will rest</l>
<l>Within the realm thou governest,</l>
<l>But all will fly indignant hence:</l>
<l>So great thy trespass and offence.</l>
<l>I marvel, when thy crime I see,</l>
<l>Earth yawns not quick to swallow thee;</l>
<l>And that the Bráhman saints prepare</l>
<l>No burning scourge thy soul to scare,</l>
<l>With cries of shame to smite thee, bent</l>
<l>Upon our Ráma's banishment.</l>
<l>The Mango tree with axes fell,</l>
<l>And tend instead the Neem tree well,</l>
<l>Still watered with all care the tree</l>
<l>Will never sweet and pleasant be.</l>
<l>Thy mother's faults to thee descend,</l>
<l>And with thy borrowed nature blend.</l>
<l>True is the ancient saw: the Neem</l>
<l>Can ne'er distil a honeyed stream.</l>
<l>Taught by the tale of long ago</l>
<l>Thy mother's hateful sin we know.</l>
<l>A bounteous saint, as all have heard,</l>
<l>A boon upon thy sire conferred,</l>
<l>And all the eloquence revealed</l>
<l>That fills the wood, the flood, the field.</l>
<l>No creature walked, or swam, or flew,</l>
<l>But he its varied language knew.</l>
<l>One morn upon his couch he heard</l>
<l>The chattering of a gorgeous bird.</l>
<l>And as he marked its close intent</l>
<l>He laughed aloud in merriment.</l>
<l>Thy mother furious with her lord,</l>
<l>And fain to perish by the cord,</l>

<l><q rend="post">O Monarch, why thou laughest so.</q></l>
<pb n="137"/><anchor id="Pg137"/>

<l>This very hour would be my last,</l>
<l><q rend="post">For death, be sure would follow fast.</q></l>

<l><q rend="pre">Tell me the cause; then live or die:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">I will not brook thy laugh, not I.</q></l>
<l>Thus by his darling wife addressed,</l>

<l>To that kind saint his story told</l>
<l>Who gave the wondrous gift of old.</l>
<l>He listened to the king's complaint,</l>
<l>And thus in answer spoke the saint:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">King, let her quit thy home or die,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">But never with her prayer comply.</q></l>
<l>The saint's reply his trouble stilled,</l>
<l>And all his heart with pleasure filled.</l>
<l>Thy mother from his home he sent,</l>
<l>And days like Lord Kuvera's spent.</l>
<l>So thou wouldst force the king, misled</l>
<l>By thee, in evil paths to tread,</l>
<l>And bent on evil wouldst begin,</l>
<l>Through folly, this career of sin.</l>
<l>Most true, methinks, in thee is shown</l>
<l>The ancient saw so widely known:</l>

<l>And girls their mothers' nature share.</l>
<l>So be not thou. For pity's sake</l>

<l>Thy husband's will, O Queen, obey,</l>
<l>And be the people's hope and stay,</l>
<l>O, do not, urged by folly, draw</l>
<l>The king to tread on duty's law.</l>
<l>The lord who all the world sustains,</l>
<l>Bright as the God o'er Gods who reigns.</l>
<l>Our glorious king, by sin unstained,</l>

<l>No shade of fault in him is seen:</l>

<l>The freshness of her face was dried,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce could the monarch's angry speech</l>

<lg>
<l>Thus spake the virtuous sage: and then</l>
<l>Ráma addressed the king of men.</l>
<l>In laws of meek behaviour bred,</l>
<l>Thus to his sire he meekly said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">King, I renounce all earthly care,</q></l>
<l>And live in woods on woodland fare.</l>
<l>What, dead to joys, have I to do</l>
<l>With lordly train and retinue!</l>
<l>Who gives his elephant and yet</l>
<l>Upon the girths his heart will set?</l>
<l>How can a cord attract his eyes</l>
<l>Who gives away the nobler prize?</l>
<l>Best of the good, with me be led</l>
<l>No host, my King with banners spread.</l>
<l>All wealth, all lordship I resign:</l>
<l>The hermit's dress alone be mine.</l>
<l>Before I go, have here conveyed</l>
<l>A little basket and a spade.</l>
<l>With these alone I go, content,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With her own hands Kaikeyí took</l>
<l>The hermit coats of bark, and, <q>Look,</q></l>
<l>She cried with bold unblushing brow</l>
<l>Before the concourse, <q>Dress thee now.</q></l>
<l>That lion leader of the brave</l>
<l>Took from her hand the dress she gave,</l>
<l>Cast his fine raiment on the ground,</l>
<pb n="139"/><anchor id="Pg139"/>
<l>And round his waist the vesture bound.</l>
<l>Then quick the hero Lakshmaṇ too</l>
<l>His garment from his shoulders threw,</l>
<l>And, in the presence of his sire,</l>
<l>Indued the ascetic's rough attire.</l>
<l>But Sítá, in her silks arrayed,</l>
<l>Threw glances, trembling and afraid,</l>
<l>On the bark coat she had to wear,</l>
<l>Like a shy doe that eyes the snare.</l>
<l>Ashamed and weeping for distress</l>
<l>From the queen's hand she took the dress.</l>
<l>The fair one, by her husband's side</l>
<l>Who matched heaven's minstrel monarch,<note place="foot">Chitraratha,
King of the celestial choristers.</note> cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">How bind they on their woodland dress,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Those hermits of the wilderness?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There stood the pride of Janak's race</l>
<l>Perplexed, with sad appealing face.</l>
<l>One coat the lady's fingers grasped,</l>
<l>One round her neck she feebly clasped,</l>
<l>But failed again, again, confused</l>
<l>By the wild garb she ne'er had used.</l>
<l>Then quickly hastening Ráma, pride</l>
<l>Of all who cherish virtue, tied</l>
<l>The rough bark mantle on her, o'er</l>
<l>The silken raiment that she wore.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then the sad women when they saw</l>
<l>Ráma the choice bark round her draw,</l>
<l>Rained water from each tender eye,</l>
<l>And cried aloud with bitter cry:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O, not on her, beloved, not</q></l>
<l>On Sítá falls thy mournful lot.</l>
<l>If, faithful to thy father's will,</l>
<l>Thou must go forth, leave Sítá still.</l>
<l>Let Sítá still remaining here</l>
<l>Our hearts with her loved presence cheer.</l>
<l>With Lakshmaṇ by thy side to aid</l>
<l>Seek thou, dear son, the lonely shade.</l>
<l>Unmeet, one good and fair as she</l>
<l>Should dwell in woods a devotee.</l>
<l>Let not our prayers be prayed in vain:</l>
<l>Let beauteous Sítá yet remain;</l>

<l><q rend="post">Thou wilt not here thyself abide.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then the king's venerable guide</l>
<l>Vaśishṭha, when he saw each coat</l>
<l>Enclose the lady's waist and throat,</l>
<l>Her zeal with gentle words repressed,</l>
<l>And Queen Kaikeyí thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O evil-hearted sinner, shame</q></l>
<l>Of royal Kekaya's race and name;</l>
<l>Who matchless in thy sin couldst cheat</l>
<l>Thy lord the king with vile deceit;</l>
<l>Lost to all sense of duty, know</l>
<l>Sítá to exile shall not go.</l>
<l>Sítá shall guard, as 'twere her own,</l>
<l>The precious trust of Ráma's throne.</l>
<l>Those joined by wedlock's sweet control</l>
<l>Have but one self and common soul.</l>
<l>Thus Sítá shall our empress be,</l>
<l>For Ráma's self and soul is she.</l>
<l>Or if she still to Ráma cleave</l>
<l>And for the woods the kingdom leave:</l>
<l>If naught her loving heart deter,</l>
<l>We and this town will follow her.</l>
<l>The warders of the queen shall take</l>
<l>Their wives and go for Ráma's sake,</l>
<l>The nation with its stores of grain,</l>
<l>The city's wealth shall swell his train.</l>
<l>Bharat, Śatrughna both will wear</l>
<l>Bark mantles, and his lodging share,</l>
<l>Still with their elder brother dwell</l>
<l>In the wild wood, and serve him well.</l>
<l>Rest here alone, and rule thy state</l>
<l>Unpeopled, barren, desolate;</l>
<l>Be empress of the land and trees,</l>
<l>Thou sinner whom our sorrows please.</l>
<l>The land which Ráma reigns not o'er</l>
<l>Shall bear the kingdom's name no more:</l>
<l>The woods which Ráma wanders through</l>
<l>Shall be our home and kingdom too.</l>
<l>Bharat, be sure, will never deign</l>
<l>O'er realms his father yields, to reign.</l>
<l>Nay, if the king's true son he be,</l>
<l>He will not, sonlike, dwell with thee.</l>
<l>Nay, shouldst thou from the earth arise,</l>
<l>And send thy message from the skies,</l>
<l>To his forefathers' custom true</l>
<l>No erring course would he pursue.</l>
<l>So hast thou, by thy grievous fault,</l>
<l>Offended him thou wouldst exalt.</l>
<l>In all the world none draws his breath</l>
<l>Who loves not Ráma, true to death.</l>
<l>This day, O Queen, shalt thou behold</l>
<l>Birds, deer, and beasts from lea and fold</l>

<l>Then when the people wroth and sad</l>

<l>They cried out, <q>Shame upon thee, King!</q></l>
<l>Grieved by their cry and angry look</l>

<l>So gently nurtured, soft and fair,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 4">With royal wealth supplied.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not such the pledge I gave before,</l>

<l>If aught amiss by Ráma done</l>
<l>Offend thee, O thou wicked one,</l>
<l>What least transgression canst thou find</l>
<l>In her, thou worst of womankind?</l>
<l>What shade of fault in her appears,</l>
<l>Whose full soft eye is like the deer's?</l>
<l>What canst thou blame in Janak's child,</l>
<l>So gentle, modest, true, and mild?</l>
<l>Is not one crime complete, that sent</l>
<l>My Ráma forth to banishment?</l>
<l>And wilt thou other sins commit,</l>
<l>Thou wicked one, to double it?</l>
<l>This is the pledge and oath I swore,</l>

<l>Ere failed his senses for distress.</l>
<l>Convulsed with woe, his soul that shook,</l>

<l>Or if he looked with failing eye</l>
<l>He could not to the chief reply.</l>
<l>By pangs of bitter grief assailed,</l>

<l>While Ráma filled his every thought.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This hand of mine in days ere now</q></l>

<l>Hence comes, I ween, this hour of pain.</l>
<l>Not till the hour is come to die</l>

<l>Unconscious there he lay: at length</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He heard the monarch, and obeyed,</l>
<l>With ready feet that ne'er delayed,</l>
<l>And brought before the palace gate</l>
<l>The horses and the car of state.</l>
<l>Then to the monarch's son he sped,</l>

<l>That the light car which gold made fair,</l>

<l>King Daśaratha called in haste</l>
<l>The lord o'er all his treasures placed.</l>
<l>And spoke, well skilled in place and time,</l>
<l>His will to him devoid of crime:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Count all the years she has to live</q></l>
<l>Afar in forest wilds, and give</l>
<l>To Sítá robes and gems of price</l>
<l><q rend="post">As for the time may well suffice.</q></l>
<l>Quick to the treasure-room he went,</l>
<l>Charged by that king most excellent,</l>
<l>Brought the rich stores, and gave them all</l>
<l>To Sítá in the monarch's hall.</l>
<l>The Maithil dame of high descent</l>
<l>Received each robe and ornament,</l>
<l>And tricked those limbs, whose lines foretold</l>
<l>High destiny, with gems and gold.</l>
<l>So well adorned, so fair to view,</l>
<l>A glory through the hall she threw:</l>
<l>So, when the Lord of Light upsprings,</l>
<l>His radiance o'er the sky he flings.</l>
<l>Then Queen Kauśalyá spake at last,</l>
<l>With loving arms about her cast,</l>
<l>Pressed lingering kisses on her head,</l>
<l>And to the high-souled lady said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah, in this faithless world below</q></l>
<l>When dark misfortune comes and woe,</l>
<l>Wives, loved and cherished every day,</l>
<l>Neglect their lords and disobey.</l>
<l>Yes, woman's nature still is this:—</l>
<l>After long days of calm and bliss</l>
<l>When some light grief her spirit tries,</l>
<l>She changes all her love, or flies.</l>
<l>Young wives are thankless, false in soul,</l>
<l>With roving hearts that spurn control.</l>
<l>Brooding on sin and quickly changed,</l>
<l>In one short hour their love estranged.</l>
<l>Not glorious deed or lineage fair,</l>
<l>Not knowledge, gift, or tender care</l>
<l>In chains of lasting love can bind</l>
<l>A woman's light inconstant mind.</l>
<l>But those good dames who still maintain</l>
<l>What right, truth, Scripture, rule ordain—</l>
<l>No holy thing in their pure eyes</l>
<l>With one beloved husband vies.</l>
<l>Nor let thy lord my son, condemned</l>
<l>To exile, be by thee contemned,</l>
<l>For be he poor or wealthy, he</l>
<l><q rend="post">Is as a God, dear child, to thee.</q></l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Sítá heard Kauśalyá's speech</l>
<l>Her duty and her gain to teach,</l>
<l>She joined her palms with reverent grace</l>
<l>And gave her answer face to face:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">All will I do, forgetting naught,</q></l>
<l>Which thou, O honoured Queen, hast taught.</l>
<l>I know, have heard, and deep have stored</l>

<l>Not me, good Queen, shouldst thou include</l>
<l>Among the faithless multitude.</l>
<l>Its own sweet light the moon shall leave</l>
<l>Ere I to duty cease to cleave.</l>
<l>The stringless lute gives forth no strain,</l>
<l>The wheelless car is urged in vain;</l>
<l>No joy a lordless dame, although</l>
<l>Blest with a hundred sons, can know.</l>
<l>From father, brother, and from son</l>
<l>A measured share of joy is won:</l>
<l>Who would not honour, love, and bless</l>
<l>Her lord, whose gifts are measureless?</l>
<l>Thus trained to think, I hold in awe</l>
<l>Scripture's command and duty's law.</l>
<l>Him can I hold in slight esteem?</l>
<l><q rend="post">Her lord is woman's God, I deem.</q></l>
<l>Kauśalyá heard the lady's speech,</l>
<l>Nor failed those words her heart to reach.</l>
<l>Then, pure in mind, she gave to flow</l>
<l>The tear that sprang of joy and woe.</l>
<l>Then duteous Ráma forward came</l>
<l>And stood before the honoured dame,</l>
<l>And joining reverent hands addressed</l>
<l>The queen in rank above the rest:</l>

<head>Canto XL. Ráma's Departure.</head>

<lg>
<l>Then Ráma, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ bent</l>
<l>At the king's feet, and sadly went</l>
<pb n="142"/><anchor id="Pg142"/>
<l>Round him with slow steps reverent.</l>
<l>When Ráma of the duteous heart</l>
<l>Had gained his sire's consent to part,</l>
<l>With Sítá by his side he paid</l>
<l>Due reverence to the queen dismayed.</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ, with affection meet,</l>
<l>Bowed down and clasped his mother's feet.</l>
<l>Sumitrá viewed him as he pressed</l>
<l>Her feet, and thus her son addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Neglect not Ráma wandering there,</q></l>
<l>But tend him with thy faithful care.</l>
<l>In hours of wealth, in time of woe,</l>
<l>Him, sinless son, thy refuge know.</l>
<l>From this good law the just ne'er swerve,</l>
<l>That younger sons the eldest serve,</l>
<l>And to this righteous rule incline</l>
<l>All children of thine ancient line—</l>
<l>Freely to give, reward each rite,</l>
<l>Nor spare their bodies in the fight.</l>
<l>Let Ráma Daśaratha be,</l>
<l>Look upon Sítá as on me,</l>
<l>And let the cot wherein you dwell</l>
<l><q rend="post">Be thine Ayodhyá. Fare thee well.</q></l>
<l>Her blessing thus Sumitrá gave</l>
<l>To him whose soul to Ráma clave,</l>
<l>Exclaiming, when her speech was done,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Go forth, O Lakshmaṇ, go, my son.</q></l>
<l>Go forth, my son to win success,</l>
<l>High victory and happiness.</l>
<l>Go forth thy foemen to destroy,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And turn again at last with joy.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As Mátali his charioteer</l>
<l>Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear,</l>
<l>Sumantra, palm to palm applied,</l>
<l>In reverence trained, to Ráma cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O famous Prince, my car ascend,—</q></l>
<l>May blessings on thy course attend,—</l>
<l>And swiftly shall my horses flee</l>
<l>And place thee where thou biddest me.</l>
<l>The fourteen years thou hast to stay</l>
<l>Far in the wilds, begin to-day;</l>
<l><q rend="post">For Oueen Kaikeyí cries, Away.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Sítá, best of womankind,</l>
<l>Ascended, with a tranquil mind,</l>
<l>Soon as her toilet task was done,</l>
<l>That chariot brilliant as the sun.</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ true and bold</l>
<l>Sprang on the car adorned with gold.</l>
<l>The king those years had counted o'er,</l>
<l>And given Sítá robes and store</l>
<l>Of precious ornaments to wear</l>
<l>When following her husband there.</l>
<l>The brothers in the car found place</l>
<l>For nets and weapons of the chase,</l>
<l>There warlike arms and mail they laid,</l>
<l>A leathern basket and a spade.</l>
<l>Soon as Sumantra saw the three</l>
<l>Were seated in the chariot, he</l>
<l>Urged on each horse of noble breed,</l>
<l>Who matched the rushing wind in speed.</l>
<l>As thus the son of Raghu went</l>
<l>Forth for his dreary banishment,</l>
<l>Chill numbing grief the town assailed,</l>
<l>All strength grew weak, all spirit failed,</l>
<l>Ayodhyá through her wide extent</l>
<l>Was filled with tumult and lament:</l>
<l>Steeds neighed and shook the bells they bore,</l>
<l>Each elephant returned a roar.</l>
<l>Then all the city, young and old,</l>
<l>Wild with their sorrow uncontrolled,</l>
<l>Rushed to the car, as, from the sun</l>
<l>The panting herds to water run.</l>
<l>Before the car, behind, they clung,</l>
<l>And there as eagerly they hung,</l>
<l>With torrents streaming from their eyes,</l>
<l>Called loudly with repeated cries:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Listen, Sumantra: draw thy rein;</q></l>
<l>Drive gently, and thy steeds restrain.</l>
<l>Once more on Ráma will we gaze,</l>
<l>Now to be lost for many days.</l>
<l>The queen his mother has, be sure,</l>
<l>A heart of iron, to endure</l>
<l>To see her godlike Ráma go,</l>
<l>Nor feel it shattered by the blow.</l>
<l>Sítá, well done! Videha's pride,</l>
<l>Still like his shadow by his side;</l>
<l>Rejoicing in thy duty still</l>
<l>As sunlight cleaves to Meru's hill.</l>
<l>Thou, Lakshmaṇ, too, hast well deserved,</l>
<l>Who from thy duty hast not swerved,</l>
<l>Tending the peer of Gods above,</l>
<l>Whose lips speak naught but words of love.</l>
<l>Thy firm resolve is nobly great,</l>
<l>And high success on thee shall wait.</l>
<l>Yea, thou shalt win a priceless meed—</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thy path with him to heaven shall lead.</q></l>
<l>As thus they spake, they could not hold</l>
<l>The tears that down their faces rolled,</l>
<l>While still they followed for a space</l>
<l>Their darling of Ikshváku's race.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There stood surrounded by a ring</l>
<l>Of mournful wives the mournful king;</l>
<l>For, <q>I will see once more,</q> he cried,</l>
<l><q>Mine own dear son,</q> and forth he hied.</l>
<l>As he came near, there rose the sound</l>
<l>Of weeping, as the dames stood round.</l>
<l>So the she-elephants complain</l>
<l>When their great lord and guide is slain.</l>
<l>Kakutstha's son, the king of men,</l>
<l>The glorious sire, looked troubled then,</l>
<l>As the full moon is when dismayed</l>
<l>By dark eclipse's threatening shade.</l>
<l>Then Daśaratha's son, designed</l>
<l>For highest fate of lofty mind,</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Away, away! why linger here?</q></l>

<l>Forth as the long-armed hero went,</l>
<pb n="143"/><anchor id="Pg143"/>
<l>The dust his chariot wheels up sent</l>
<l>Was laid by streams that ever flowed</l>
<l>From their sad eyes who filled the road.</l>
<l>Then, sprung of woe, from eyes of all</l>
<l>The women drops began to fall,</l>
<l>As from each lotus on the lake</l>
<l>The darting fish the water shake.</l>
<l>When he, the king of high renown,</l>
<l>Saw that one thought held all the town,</l>
<l>Like some tall tree he fell and lay,</l>
<l>Whose root the axe has hewn away.</l>
<l>Then straight a mighty cry from those</l>
<l>Who followed Ráma's car arose,</l>
<l>Who saw their monarch fainting there</l>
<l>Beneath that grief too great to bear.</l>
<l>Then <q>Ráma, Ráma!</q> with the cry</l>
<l>Of <q>Ah, his mother!</q> sounded high,</l>
<l>As all the people wept aloud</l>
<l>Around the ladies' sorrowing crowd.</l>
<l>When Ráma backward turned his eye,</l>
<l>And saw the king his father lie</l>
<l>With troubled sense and failing limb,</l>
<l>And the sad queen, who followed him,</l>
<l>Like some young creature in the net,</l>
<l>That will not, in its misery, let</l>
<l>Its wild eyes on its mother rest,</l>
<l>So, by the bonds of duty pressed,</l>
<l>His mother's look he could not meet.</l>
<l>He saw them with their weary feet,</l>
<l>Who, used to bliss, in cars should ride,</l>
<l>Who ne'er by sorrow should be tried,</l>
<l>And, as one mournful look he cast,</l>
<l><q>Drive on,</q> he cried, <q>Sumantra, fast.</q></l>
<l>As when the driver's torturing hook</l>
<l>Goads on an elephant, the look</l>
<l>Of sire and mother in despair</l>
<l>Was more than Ráma's heart could bear.</l>
<l>As mother kine to stalls return</l>
<l>Which hold the calves for whom they yearn,</l>
<l>So to the car she tried to run</l>
<l>As a cow seeks her little one.</l>
<l>Once and again the hero's eyes</l>
<l>Looked on his mother, as with cries</l>
<l>Of woe she called and gestures wild,</l>
<l><q>O Sítá, Lakshmaṇ, O my child!</q></l>
<l><q>Stay,</q> cried the king, <q>thy chariot stay:</q></l>
<l><q>On, on,</q> cried Ráma, <q>speed away.</q></l>
<l>As one between two hosts, inclined</l>
<l>To neither was Sumantra's mind.</l>
<l>But Ráma spake these words again:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">A lengthened woe is bitterest pain.</q></l>
<l>On, on; and if his wrath grow hot,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thine answer be, <q>I heard thee not.</q></q></l>
<l>Sumantra, at the chief's behest,</l>
<l>Dismissed the crowd that toward him pressed,</l>
<l>And, as he bade, to swiftest speed</l>
<l>Urged on his way each willing steed.</l>
<l>The king's attendants parted thence,</l>
<l>And paid him heart-felt reverence:</l>
<l>In mind, and with the tears he wept,</l>
<l>Each still his place near Ráma kept.</l>
<l>As swift away the horses sped,</l>
<l>His lords to Daśaratha said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">To follow him whom thou again</q></l>

<l>The lion chief with hands upraised</l>
<l>Was born from eyes that fondly gazed.</l>
<l>But then the ladies' bower was rent</l>
<l>With cries of weeping and lament:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Where goes he now, our lord, the sure</q></l>
<l>Protector of the friendless poor,</l>
<l>In whom the wretched and the weak</l>
<l>Defence and aid were wont to seek?</l>
<l>All words of wrath he turned aside,</l>
<l>And ne'er, when cursed, in ire replied.</l>
<l>He shared his people's woe, and stilled</l>
<l>The troubled breast which rage had filled.</l>
<l>Our chief, on lofty thoughts intent,</l>
<l>In glorious fame preëminent:</l>
<l>As on his own dear mother, thus</l>
<l>He ever looked on each of us.</l>
<l>Where goes he now? His sire's behest,</l>
<l>By Queen Kaikeyí's guile distressed,</l>
<l>Has banished to the forest hence</l>
<l>Him who was all the world's defence.</l>
<l>Ah, senseless King, to drive away</l>
<l>The hope of men, their guard and stay,</l>
<l>To banish to the distant wood</l>
<l><q rend="post">Ráma the duteous, true, and good!</q></l>
<l>The royal dames, like cows bereaved</l>

<l>The monarch heard them as they wailed,</l>
<l>And by the fire of grief assailed</l>
<l>For his dear son, he bowed his head,</l>
<l>And all his sense and memory fled.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then were no fires of worship fed,</l>

<l>While yet the dust was seen afar</l>
<l>That marked the course of Ráma's car,</l>
<l>The glory of Ikshváku's race</l>
<l>Turned not away his eager face.</l>
<l>While yet his duteous son he saw</l>
<l>He could not once his gaze withdraw,</l>
<l>But rooted to the spot remained</l>
<l>With eyes that after Ráma strained.</l>
<l>But when that dust no more he viewed,</l>
<l>Fainting he fell by grief subdued.</l>
<l>To his right hand Kauśalyá went,</l>
<l>And ready aid the lady lent,</l>
<l>While Bharat's loving mother tried</l>
<l>To raise him on the other side.</l>
<l>The king, within whose ordered soul</l>
<l>Justice and virtue held control,</l>
<l>To Queen Kaikeyí turned and said,</l>

<l>By many a beauty's tender hand:</l>
<l>Where will he lie with log or stone</l>
<l>Beneath him for a pillow thrown,</l>
<l>To leave at morn his earthy bed,</l>
<l>Neglected, and with dust o'erspread,</l>
<l>As from the flood with sigh and pant</l>

<l>But empty houses, courts, and ways.</l>
<l>Closed were the temples: countless feet</l>
<l>No longer trod the royal street,</l>
<l>And thinking of his son he viewed</l>
<l>Men weak and worn and woe-subdued.</l>
<l>As sinks the sun into a cloud,</l>
<l>So passed he on, and wept aloud,</l>
<l>Within that house no more to be</l>
<l>The dwelling of the banished three,</l>
<l>Brave Ráma, his Vedehan bride,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ by his brother's side:</l>
<l>Like broad still waters, when the king</l>
<l>Of all the birds that ply the wing</l>
<l>Has swooped from heaven and borne away</l>
<l>The glittering snakes that made them gay.</l>

<l>With broken utterance faint and low</l>
<l>Scarce could he speak these words of woe:</l>

<l>Ah, how will fare the exiles now,</l>

<l>O, that my years of woe were passed,</l>

<l>When I shall see my children dear,</l>
<l>Ráma, his wife, and Lakshmaṇ here!</l>

<lg>
<l>Kauśalyá ceased her sad lament,</l>
<l>Of beauteous dames most excellent.</l>
<l>Sumitrá who to duty clave,</l>
<l>In righteous words this answer gave:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Dear Queen, all noble virtues grace</q></l>
<l>Thy son, of men the first in place.</l>
<l>Why dost thou shed these tears of woe</l>
<l>With bitter grief lamenting so?</l>
<l>If Ráma, leaving royal sway</l>
<l>Has hastened to the woods away,</l>
<l>'Tis for his high-souled father's sake</l>
<l>That he his premise may not break.</l>
<l>He to the path of duty clings</l>
<l>Which lordly fruit hereafter brings—</l>
<l>The path to which the righteous cleave—</l>
<l>For him, dear Queen, thou shouldst not grieve.</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ too, the blameless-souled,</l>
<l>The same high course with him will hold,</l>
<l>And mighty bliss on him shall wait,</l>
<l>So tenderly compassionate.</l>
<l>And Sítá, bred with tender care,</l>
<l>Well knows what toils await her there,</l>
<l>But in her love she will not part</l>
<l>From Ráma of the virtuous heart.</l>
<l>Now has thy son through all the world</l>
<l>The banner of his fame unfurled;</l>
<l>True, modest, careful of his vow,</l>
<l>What has he left to aim at now?</l>
<l>The sun will mark his mighty soul,</l>
<l>His wisdom, sweetness, self-control,</l>
<l>Will spare from pain his face and limb,</l>
<l>And with soft radiance shine for him.</l>
<l>For him through forest glades shall spring</l>
<l>A soft auspicious breeze, and bring</l>
<l>Its tempered heat and cold to play</l>
<l>Around him ever night and day.</l>
<l>The pure cold moonbeams shall delight</l>
<l>The hero as he sleeps at night,</l>
<l>And soothe him with the soft caress</l>
<l>Of a fond parent's tenderness.</l>
<l>To him, the bravest of the brave,</l>
<l>His heavenly arms the Bráhman gave,</l>
<l>When fierce Suváhu dyed the plain</l>
<l>With his life-blood by Ráma slain.</l>
<l>Still trusting to his own right arm</l>
<l>Thy hero son will fear no harm:</l>
<l>As in his father's palace, he</l>
<l>In the wild woods will dauntless be.</l>
<l>Whene'er he lets his arrows fly</l>
<l>His stricken foemen fall and die:</l>
<l>And is that prince of peerless worth</l>
<l>Too weak to keep and sway the earth?</l>
<l>His sweet pure soul, his beauty's charm,</l>
<l>His hero heart, his warlike arm,</l>
<l>Will soon redeem his rightful reign</l>
<l>When from the woods he comes again.</l>
<l>The Bráhmans on the prince's head</l>
<l>King-making drops shall quickly shed,</l>
<l>And Sítá, Earth, and Fortune share</l>
<l>The glories which await the heir.</l>
<l>For him, when forth his chariot swept,</l>
<l>The crowd that thronged Ayodhyá wept,</l>
<l>With agonizing woe distressed.</l>
<l>With him in hermít's mantle dressed</l>
<l>In guise of Sítá Lakshmí went,</l>
<l>And none his glory may prevent.</l>
<l>Yea, naught to him is high or hard,</l>
<l>Before whose steps, to be his guard,</l>
<l>Lakshmaṇ, the best who draws the bow,</l>
<l>With spear, shaft, sword rejoiced to go.</l>
<l>His wanderings in the forest o'er,</l>
<l>Thine eyes shall see thy son once more,</l>
<l>Quit thy faint heart, thy grief dispel,</l>
<l>For this, O Queen, is truth I tell.</l>
<l>Thy son returning, moonlike, thence,</l>
<l>Shall at thy feet do reverence,</l>
<l>And, blest and blameless lady, thou</l>
<l>Shalt see his head to touch them bow,</l>
<l>Yea, thou shalt see thy son made king</l>
<l>When he returns with triumphing,</l>
<l>And how thy happy eyes will brim</l>
<l>With tears of joy to look on him!</l>
<l>Thou, blameless lady, shouldst the whole</l>
<l>Of the sad people here console:</l>
<l>Why in thy tender heart allow</l>
<l>This bitter grief to harbour now?</l>
<l>As the long banks of cloud distil</l>
<l>Their water when they see the hill,</l>
<pb n="147"/><anchor id="Pg147"/>

<l>Their tender love the people drew</l>

<l>The high-souled hero, as he went</l>
<l>Forth from his home to banishment.</l>
<l>The king himself his friends obeyed,</l>
<l>And turned him homeward as they prayed.</l>
<l>But yet the people turned not back,</l>

<l>Though much his people prayed and wept,</l>

<l>To keep the king his father true.</l>
<l>Deep in the hero's bosom sank</l>
<l>Their love, whose signs his glad eye drank.</l>
<l>He spoke to cheer them, as his own</l>

<l>In judgment old, in years a child,</l>
<l>With hero virtues meek and mild,</l>
<l>A fitting lord is he to cheer</l>
<l>His people and remove their fear.</l>
<l>In him all kingly gifts abound,</l>
<l>More noble than in me are found:</l>
<l>Imperial prince, well proved and tried—</l>
<l>Obey him as your lord and guide.</l>
<l>And grant, I pray, the boon I ask:</l>

<l>The saintly twice-born, triply old</l>
<l>In glory, knowledge, seasons told,</l>

<lg>
<l>When Ráma, chief of Raghu's race,</l>
<l>Arrived at that delightful place,</l>
<l>He looked on Sítá first, and then</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ spake the lord of men:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now first the shades of night descend</q></l>
<l>Since to the wilds our steps we bend.</l>
<l>Joy to thee, brother! do not grieve</l>
<l>For our dear home and all we leave.</l>
<l>The woods unpeopled seem to weep</l>
<l>Around us, as their tenants creep</l>
<l>Or fly to lair and den and nest,</l>
<l>Both bird and beast, to seek their rest.</l>
<l>Methinks Ayodhyá's royal town</l>
<l>Where dwells my sire of high renown,</l>
<l>With all her men and dames to-night</l>
<l>Will mourn us vanished from their sight.</l>
<l>For, by his virtues won, they cling</l>
<l>In fond affection to their king,</l>
<l>And thee and me, O brave and true,</l>
<l>And Bharat and Śatrughna too.</l>
<l>I for my sire and mother feel</l>
<l>Deep sorrow o'er my bosom steal,</l>
<l>Lest mourning us, oppressed with fears,</l>
<l>They blind their eyes with endless tears.</l>
<l>Yet Bharat's duteous love will show</l>
<l>Sweet comfort in their hours of woe,</l>
<l>And with kind words their hearts sustain,</l>
<l>Suggesting duty, bliss, and gain.</l>
<l>I mourn my parents now no more:</l>
<l>I count dear Bharat's virtues o'er,</l>
<l>And his kind love and care dispel</l>
<l>The doubts I had, and all is well.</l>
<l>And thou thy duty wouldst not shun,</l>
<l>And, following me, hast nobly done;</l>
<l>Else, bravest, I should need a band</l>
<l>Around my wife as guard to stand.</l>
<l>On this first night, my thirst to slake,</l>
<l>Some water only will I take:</l>
<l>Thus, brother, thus my will decides,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Though varied store the wood provides.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having said to Lakshmaṇ, he</l>
<l>Addressed in turn Sumantra: <q rend="pre">Be</q></l>
<l>Most diligent to-night, my friend,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And with due care thy horses tend.</q></l>
<l>The sun had set: Sumantra tied</l>
<l>His noble horses side by side,</l>
<l>Gave store of grass with liberal hand,</l>
<l>And rested near them on the strand.</l>
<l>Each paid the holy evening rite,</l>
<l>And when around them fell the night,</l>
<l>The charioteer, with Lakshmaṇ's aid,</l>
<l>A lowly bed for Ráma laid.</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ Ráma bade adieu,</l>
<l>And then by Sítá's side he threw</l>
<l>His limbs upon the leafy bed</l>
<l>Their care upon the bank had spread.</l>
<l>When Lakshmaṇ saw the couple slept,</l>
<l>Still on the strand his watch he kept,</l>
<l>Still with Sumantra there conversed,</l>
<l>And Ráma's varied gifts rehearsed.</l>
<l>All night he watched, nor sought repose,</l>
<l>Till on the earth the sun arose:</l>
<l>With him Sumantra stayed awake,</l>
<l>And still of Ráma's virtues spake.</l>
<l>Thus, near the river's grassy shore</l>

<l>The glorious hero left his bed,</l>
<l>Looked on the sleeping crowd, and said</l>

<l>We followed Ráma on his way,</l>

<l>Ayodhyá's town with sorrow dumb,</l>
<l>Without our lord will see us come,</l>
<l>And hopeless misery will strike</l>
<l>Elder, and child, and dame alike.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Complaining thus with varied cry</l>
<l>They tossed their aged arms on high,</l>
<l>And their sad hearts with grief were wrung,</l>
<l>Like cows who sorrow for their young.</l>
<l>A while they followed on the road</l>
<l>Which traces of his chariot showed,</l>

<l>With wearied hearts, in grief and shame</l>
<l>They took the road by which they came,</l>

<l>From side to side was naught but care.</l>
<l>With troubled spirits quite cast down</l>
<l>They looked upon the royal town,</l>
<l>And from their eyes, oppressed with woe,</l>
<l>Their tears again began to flow.</l>
<l>Of Ráma reft, the city wore</l>
<l>No look of beauty as before,</l>
<l>Like a dull river or a lake</l>
<l>By Garuḍ robbed of every snake.</l>
<l>Dark, dismal as the moonless sky,</l>
<l>Or as a sea whose bed is dry,</l>
<l>So sad, to every pleasure dead,</l>
<l>They saw the town, disquieted.</l>
<l>On to their houses, high and vast,</l>
<l>Where stores of precious wealth were massed,</l>
<l>The melancholy Bráhmans passed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their hearts with anguish cleft:</l>

<lg>
<l>When those who forth with Ráma went</l>
<l>Back to the town their steps had bent,</l>
<l>It seemed that death had touched and chilled</l>
<l>Those hearts which piercing sorrow filled.</l>
<l>Each to his several mansion came,</l>
<l>And girt by children and his dame,</l>
<l>From his sad eyes the water shed</l>
<l>That o'er his cheek in torrents spread.</l>
<l>All joy was fled: oppressed with cares</l>
<l>No bustling trader showed his wares.</l>
<l>Each shop had lost its brilliant look,</l>
<l>Each householder forbore to cook.</l>
<l>No hand with joy its earnings told,</l>
<l>None cared to win a wealth of gold,</l>
<l>And scarce the youthful mother smiled</l>
<l>To see her first, her new-born child.</l>
<l>In every house a woman wailed,</l>
<l>And her returning lord assailed</l>
<l>With keen taunt piercing like the steel</l>
<l>That bids the tusked monster kneel:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What now to them is wedded dame,</q></l>
<l>What house and home and dearest aim,</l>
<l>Or son, or bliss, or gathered store,</l>
<l>Whose eyes on Ráma look no more!</l>
<l>There is but one in all the earth,</l>
<l>One man alone of real worth,</l>
<l>Lakshmaṇ, who follows, true and good,</l>
<l>Ráma, with Sítá, through the wood.</l>
<l>Made holy for all time we deem</l>
<l>Each pool and fountain, lake and stream,</l>
<l>If great Kakutstha's son shall choose</l>
<l>Their water for his bath to use.</l>
<l>Each forest, dark with lovely trees,</l>
<l>Shall yearn Kakutstha's son to please;</l>
<l>Each mountain peak and woody hill,</l>
<l>Each mighty flood and mazy rill,</l>
<l>Each rocky height, each shady grove</l>
<l>Where the blest feet of Ráma rove,</l>
<l>Shall gladly welcome with the best</l>
<l>Of all they have their honoured guest.</l>
<l>The trees that clustering blossoms bear,</l>
<l>And bright-hued buds to gem their hair,</l>
<l>The heart of Ráma shall delight,</l>
<l>And cheer him on the breezy height.</l>
<l>For him the upland slopes will show</l>
<l>The fairest roots and fruit that grow,</l>
<l>And all their wealth before him fling</l>
<l>Ere the due hour of ripening.</l>
<l>For him each earth-upholding hill</l>
<l>Its crystal water shall distil,</l>
<l>And all its floods shall be displayed</l>
<l>In many a thousand-hued cascade.</l>
<l>Where Ráma stands is naught to fear,</l>
<l>No danger comes if he be near;</l>
<l>For all who live on him depend,</l>
<l>The world's support, and lord, and friend.</l>
<l>Ere in too distant wilds he stray,</l>
<l>Let us to Ráma speed away,</l>
<l>For rich reward on those will wait</l>

<l>For who would care to linger here,</l>

<l>Who, mid the mourners, hope for bliss</l>
<l>In a poor soulless town like this?</l>
<l>If Queen Kaikeyí's treacherous sin,</l>

<l>For, Ráma forced from home to fly,</l>

<l>Sad, robbed of merits, drug the cup</l>

<l>Or share the exiled Ráma's lot,</l>
<l>Or seek some land that knows her not.</l>

<lg>
<l>Now Ráma, ere the night was fled,</l>
<l>O'er many a league of road had sped,</l>
<l>Till, as his course he onward held,</l>
<l>The morn the shades of night dispelled.</l>
<l>The rites of holy dawn he paid,</l>
<l>And all the country round surveyed.</l>
<l>He saw, as still he hurried through</l>
<l>With steeds which swift as arrows flew,</l>
<l>Hamlets and groves with blossoms fair,</l>
<l>And fields which showed the tillers' care,</l>
<l>While from the clustered dwellings near</l>
<l>The words of peasants reached his ear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Fie on our lord the king, whose soul</q></l>
<l>Is yielded up to love's control!</l>
<l>Fie on the vile Kaikeyí! Shame</l>
<l>On that malicious sinful dame,</l>
<l>Who, keenly bent on cruel deeds,</l>
<l>No bounds of right and virtue heeds,</l>
<l>But with her wicked art has sent</l>
<l>So good a prince to banishment,</l>
<l>Wise, tender-hearted, ruling well</l>
<l>His senses, in the woods to dwell.</l>
<l>Ah cruel king! his heart of steel</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These words he heard the peasants say,</l>
<l>Who dwelt in hamlets by the way,</l>
<l>And, lord of all the realm by right,</l>
<l>Through Kośala pursued his flight.</l>

<l>Of Vedaśrutí's stream he passed,</l>
<l>And onward to the place he sped</l>
<l>By Saint Agastya tenanted.</l>
<l>Still on for many an hour he hied,</l>
<l>And crossed the stream whose cooling tide</l>
<l>Rolls onward till she meets the sea,</l>
<l>The herd-frequented Gomatí.<note place="foot">Known to Europeans as the
Goomtee.</note></l>
<l>Borne by his rapid horses o'er,</l>
<l>He reached that river's further shore.</l>
<l>And Syandiká's, whose swan-loved stream</l>
<l>Resounded with the peacock's scream.</l>
<l>Then as he journeyed on his road</l>
<l>To his Videhan bride he showed</l>
<l>The populous land which Manu old</l>
<l>To King Ikshváku gave to hold.</l>
<l>The glorious prince, the lord of men</l>
<l>Looked on the charioteer, and then</l>
<l>Voiced like a wild swan, loud and clear,</l>
<l>He spake these words and bade him hear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">When shall I, with returning feet</q></l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus speeding on,—no rest or stay,—</l>

<l>So through the wide and fair extent</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the high souled chief they bent,</l>

<l>And then with bitter wailing, they</l>
<l>Departed each his several way.</l>
<l>Like the great sun engulfed by night,</l>
<l>The hero sped beyond their sight,</l>
<l>While still the people mourned his fate</l>

<l>The car-borne chieftain passed the bound</l>

<l>Where dwells content a well-fed race,</l>

<l>Filled with the voice of praise and prayer:</l>
<l>Each hamlet worth a monarch's care.</l>
<l>Before him three-pathed Gangá rolled</l>
<l>Her heavenly waters bright and cold;</l>
<l>O'er her pure breast no weeds were spread,</l>
<l>Her banks were hermit-visited.</l>
<l>The car-borne hero saw the tide</l>

<l>When Ráma reached the lovely tree,</l>
<l>With Sítá and with Lakshmaṇ, he</l>
<l>Alighted from the car: with speed</l>
<l>Sumantra loosed each weary steed.</l>
<l>And, hand to hand in reverence laid,</l>
<l>Stood near to Ráma in the shade.</l>
<l>Ráma's dear friend, renowned by fame,</l>
<l>Who of Nisháda lineage came,</l>
<l>Guha, the mighty chief, adored</l>
<l>Through all the land as sovereign lord,</l>

<l>Laid both his hands upon his head</l>
<l>Bowed to those lotus feet, and said:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again the hero spake, as round</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Guha, I see that all is well</q></l>
<l>With thee and those who with thee dwell;</l>
<l>That health and bliss and wealth attend</l>
<l>Thy realm, thyself, and every friend.</l>
<l>But all these friendly gifts of thine,</l>
<l>Bound to refuse, I must decline.</l>
<l>Grass, bark, and hide my only wear,</l>
<l>And woodland roots and fruit my fare,</l>
<l>On duty all my heart is set;</l>
<l>I seek the woods, an anchoret.</l>
<l>A little grass and corn to feed</l>
<l>The horses—this is all I need.</l>
<l>So by this favour, King, alone</l>

<head>Canto LII. The Crossing Of Gangá.</head>

<lg>
<l>Soon as the shades of night had fled,</l>
<l>Uprising from his lowly bed,</l>
<l>Ráma the famous, broad of chest,</l>
<l>His brother Lakshmaṇ thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now swift upsprings the Lord of Light,</q></l>
<l>And fled is venerable night.</l>
<pb n="154"/><anchor id="Pg154"/>
<l>That dark-winged bird the Koïl now</l>
<l>Is calling from the topmost bough,</l>
<l>And sounding from the thicket nigh</l>
<l>Is heard the peacock's early cry.</l>
<l>Come, cross the flood that seeks the sea,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The swiftly flowing Jáhnaví.</q><note place="foot">Daughter of Jahnu,
a name of the Ganges. See <ref target="Pg055">p. 55</ref>.</note></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">King Guha heard his speech, agreed,</l>
<l>And called his minister with speed:</l>
<l><q>A boat,</q> he cried, <q rend="pre">swift, strong, and fair,</q></l>
<l>With rudder, oars, and men, prepare,</l>
<l>And place it ready by the shore</l>
<l><q rend="post">To bear the pilgrims quickly o'er.</q></l>
<l>Thus Guha spake: his followers all</l>
<l>Bestirred them at their master's call;</l>
<l>Then told the king that ready manned</l>
<l>A gay boat waited near the strand.</l>
<l>Then Guha, hand to hand applied,</l>
<l>With reverence thus to Ráma cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The boat is ready by the shore:</q></l>
<l>How, tell me, can I aid thee more?</l>
<l>O lord of men, it waits for thee</l>
<l>To cross the flood that seeks the sea.</l>
<l>O godlike keeper of thy vow,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Embark: the boat is ready now.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma, lord of glory high,</l>
<l>Thus to King Guha made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thanks for thy gracious care, my lord:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Now let the gear be placed on board.</q></l>
<l>Each bow-armed chief, in mail encased,</l>
<l>Bound sword and quiver to his waist,</l>
<l>And then with Sítá near them hied</l>
<l>Down the broad river's shelving side.</l>
<l>Then with raised palms the charioteer,</l>
<l>In lowly reverence drawing near,</l>
<l>Cried thus to Ráma good and true:</l>
<l><q>Now what remains for me to do?</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With his right hand, while answering</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">The hero touched his friend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q>Go back,</q> he said, <q rend="pre">and on the king</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">With watchful care attend.</l>
<l>Thus far, Sumantra, thou wast guide;</l>
<l><q rend="post">Now to Ayodhyá turn,</q> he cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Hence seek we leaving steeds and car,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">On foot the wood that stretches far.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sumantra, when, with grieving heart,</l>
<l>He heard the hero bid him part,</l>
<l>Thus to the bravest of the brave,</l>
<l>Ikshváku's son, his answer gave:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">In all the world men tell of naught,</q></l>
<l>To match thy deed, by heroes wrought—</l>
<l>Thus with thy brother and thy wife</l>
<l>Thrall-like to lead a forest life.</l>
<l>No meet reward of fruit repays</l>
<l>Thy holy lore, thy saintlike days,</l>
<l>Thy tender soul, thy love of truth,</l>
<l>If woe like this afflicts thy youth.</l>
<l>Thou, roaming under forest boughs</l>
<l>With thy dear brother and thy spouse</l>
<l>Shalt richer meed of glory gain</l>
<l>Than if three worlds confessed thy reign.</l>
<l>Sad is our fate, O Ráma: we,</l>
<l>Abandoned and repelled by thee,</l>
<l>Must serve as thralls Kaikeyí's will,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Imperious, wicked, born to ill.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus cried the faithful charioteer,</l>
<l>As Raghu's son, in rede his peer,</l>
<l>Was fast departing on his road,—</l>
<l>And long his tears of anguish flowed.</l>
<l>But Ráma, when those tears were dried</l>
<l>His lips with water purified,</l>
<l>And in soft accents, sweet and clear,</l>
<l>Again addressed the charioteer:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I find no heart, my friend, like thine,</q></l>
<l>So faithful to Ikshváku's line.</l>
<l>Still first in view this object keep,</l>
<l>That ne'er for me my sire may weep.</l>
<l>For he, the world's far-ruling king,</l>
<l>Is old, and wild with sorrow's sting;</l>
<l>With love's great burthen worn and weak:</l>
<l>Deem this the cause that thus I speak</l>
<l>Whate'er the high-souled king decrees</l>
<l>His loved Kaikeyí's heart to please,</l>
<l>Yea, be his order what it may,</l>
<l>Without demur thou must obey,</l>
<l>For this alone great monarchs reign,</l>
<l>That ne'er a wish be formed in vain.</l>
<l>Then, O Sumantra, well provide</l>
<l>That by no check the king be tried:</l>
<l>Nor let his heart in sorrow pine:</l>
<l>This care, my faithful friend, be thine.</l>
<l>The honoured king my father greet,</l>
<l>And thus for me my words repeat</l>
<l>To him whose senses are controlled,</l>
<l>Untired till now by grief, and old;</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ sorrow not,</q></l>
<l>O Monarch, for our altered lot:</l>
<l>The same to us, if here we roam,</l>
<l>Or if Ayodhyá be our home,</l>
<l>The fourteen years will quickly fly,</l>
<l>The happy hour will soon be nigh</l>
<l>When thou, my lord, again shalt see</l>
<l><q rend="post">Lakshmaṇ, the Maithil dame, and me.</q></l>
<l>Thus having soothed, O charioteer,</l>
<l>My father and my mother dear,</l>
<l>Let all the queens my message learn,</l>
<l>But to Kaikeyí chiefly turn.</l>
<l>With loving blessings from the three,</l>
<l>From Lakshmaṇ, Sítá, and from me,</l>
<l>My mother, Queen Kauśalyá, greet</l>
<l>With reverence to her sacred feet.</l>
<l>And add this prayer of mine: <q rend="pre">O King;</q></l>
<l>Send quickly forth and Bharat bring,</l>
<l>And set him on the royal throne</l>
<l>Which thy decree has made his own.</l>
<l>When he upon the throne is placed,</l>
<l>When thy fond arms are round him laced,</l>
<l>Thine aged heart will cease to ache</l>
<l><q rend="post">With bitter pangs for Ráma's sake.</q></l>
<pb n="155"/><anchor id="Pg155"/>
<l>And say to Bharat: <q rend="pre">See thou treat</q></l>
<l>The queens with all observance meet:</l>
<l>What care the king receives, the same</l>
<l>Show thou alike to every dame.</l>
<l>Obedience to thy father's will</l>
<l>Who chooses thee the throne to fill,</l>
<l>Will earn for thee a store of bliss</l>
<l><q rend="post"><q rend="post">Both in the world to come and this.</q></q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma bade Sumantra go</l>
<l>With thoughtful care instructed so.</l>
<l>Sumantra all his message heard,</l>
<l>And spake again, by passion stirred:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O, should deep feeling mar in aught</q></l>
<l>The speech by fond devotion taught,</l>
<l>Forgive whate'er I wildly speak:</l>
<l>My love is strong, my tongue is weak.</l>
<l>How shall I, if deprived of thee,</l>
<l>Return that mournful town to see:</l>
<l>Where sick at heart the people are</l>
<l>Because their Ráma roams afar.</l>
<l>Woe will be theirs too deep to brook</l>
<l>When on the empty car they look,</l>
<l>As when from hosts, whose chiefs are slain,</l>
<l>One charioteer comes home again.</l>
<l>This very day, I ween, is food</l>
<l>Forsworn by all the multitude,</l>
<l>Thinking that thou, with hosts to aid,</l>
<l>Art dwelling in the wild wood's shade.</l>
<l>The great despair, the shriek of woe</l>
<l>They uttered when they saw thee go,</l>
<l>Will, when I come with none beside,</l>
<l>A hundred-fold be multiplied.</l>
<l>How to Kauśalyá can I say:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Queen, I took thy son away,</q></l>
<l>And with thy brother left him well:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Weep not for him; thy woe dispel?</q></l>
<l>So false a tale I cannot frame,</l>
<l>Yet how speak truth and grieve the dame?</l>
<l>How shall these horses, fleet and bold,</l>
<l>Whom not a hand but mine can hold,</l>
<l>Bear others, wont to whirl the car</l>
<l>Wherein Ikshváku's children are!</l>
<l>Without thee, Prince, I cannot, no,</l>
<l>I cannot to Ayodhyá go.</l>
<l>Then deign, O Ráma, to relent,</l>
<l>And let me share thy banishment.</l>
<l>But if no prayers can move thy heart,</l>
<l>If thou wilt quit me and depart,</l>
<l>The flames shall end my car and me,</l>
<l>Deserted thus and reft of thee.</l>
<l>In the wild wood when foes are near,</l>
<l>When dangers check thy vows austere,</l>
<l>Borne in my car will I attend,</l>
<l>All danger and all care to end.</l>
<l>For thy dear sake I love the skill</l>
<l>That guides the steed and curbs his will:</l>
<l>And soon a forest life will be</l>
<l>As pleasant, for my love of thee.</l>
<l>And if these horses near thee dwell,</l>
<l>And serve thee in the forest well,</l>
<l>They, for their service, will not miss</l>
<l>The due reward of highest bliss.</l>
<l>Thine orders, as with thee I stray,</l>
<l>Will I with heart and head obey,</l>
<l>Prepared, for thee, without a sigh,</l>
<l>To lose Ayodhyá or the sky.</l>
<l>As one defiled with hideous sin,</l>
<l>I never more can pass within</l>
<l>Ayodhyá, city of our king,</l>
<l>Unless beside me thee I bring.</l>
<l>One wish is mine, I ask no more,</l>
<l>That, when thy banishment is o'er</l>
<l>I in my car may bear my lord,</l>
<l>Triumphant, to his home restored.</l>
<l>The fourteen years, if spent with thee,</l>
<l>Will swift as light-winged moments flee;</l>
<l>But the same years, without thee told,</l>
<l>Were magnified a hundred-fold.</l>
<l>Do not, kind lord, thy servant leave,</l>
<l>Who to his master's son would cleave,</l>
<l>And the same path with him pursue,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Devoted, tender, just and true.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again, again Sumantra made</l>
<l>His varied plaint, and wept and prayed.</l>
<l>Him Raghu's son, whose tender breast</l>
<l>Felt for his servants, thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O faithful servant, well my heart</q></l>
<l>Knows how attached and true thou art.</l>
<l>Hear thou the words I speak, and know</l>
<l>Why to the town I bid thee go.</l>
<l>Soon as Kaikeyí, youngest queen,</l>
<l>Thy coming to the town has seen,</l>
<l>No doubt will then her mind oppress</l>
<l>That Ráma roams the wilderness.</l>
<l>And so the dame, her heart content</l>
<l>With proof of Ráma's banishment,</l>
<l>Will doubt the virtuous king no more</l>
<l>As faithless to the oath he swore.</l>
<l>Chief of my cares is this, that she,</l>
<l>Youngest amid the queens, may see</l>
<l>Bharat her son securely reign</l>
<l>O'er rich Ayodhyá's wide domain.</l>
<l>For mine and for the monarch's sake</l>
<l>Do thou thy journey homeward take,</l>
<l>And, as I bade, repeat each word</l>
<l><q rend="post">That from my lips thou here hast heard.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the prince, and strove to cheer</l>
<l>The sad heart of the charioteer,</l>
<l>And then to royal Guha said</l>
<l>These words most wise and spirited:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Guha, dear friend, it is not meet</q></l>
<l>That people throng my calm retreat:</l>
<l>For I must live a strict recluse,</l>
<l>And mould my life by hermits' use.</l>
<l>I now the ancient rule accept</l>
<l>By good ascetics gladly kept.</l>
<l>I go: bring fig-tree juice that I</l>
<l><q rend="post">In matted coils my hair may tie.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Quick Guha hastened to produce,</l>
<l>For the king's son, that sacred juice.</l>
<l>Then Ráma of his long locks made,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ's too, the hermit braid.</l>
<pb n="156"/><anchor id="Pg156"/>
<l>And the two royal brothers there</l>
<l>With coats of bark and matted hair,</l>
<l>Transformed in lovely likeness stood</l>
<l>To hermit saints who love the wood.</l>
<l>So Ráma, with his brother bold,</l>
<l>A pious anchorite enrolled,</l>
<l>Obeyed the vow which hermits take,</l>
<l>And to his friend, King Guha, spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">May people, treasure, army share,</q></l>
<l>And fenced forts, thy constant care:</l>
<l>Attend to all: supremely hard</l>
<l><q rend="post">The sovereign's task, to watch and guard.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ikshváku's son, the good and brave,</l>
<l>This last farewell to Guha gave,</l>
<l>And then, with Lakshmaṇ and his bride,</l>
<l>Determined, on his way he hied.</l>
<l>Soon as he viewed, upon the shore,</l>
<l>The bark prepared to waft them o'er</l>
<l>Impetuous Gangá's rolling tide,</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ thus the chieftain cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Brother, embark; thy hand extend,</q></l>
<l>Thy gentle aid to Sítá lend:</l>
<l>With care her trembling footsteps guide,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And place the lady by thy side.</q></l>
<l>When Lakshmaṇ heard, prepared to aid,</l>
<l>His brother's words he swift obeyed.</l>
<l>Within the bark he placed the dame,</l>
<l>Then to her side the hero came.</l>
<l>Next Lakshmaṇ's elder brother, lord</l>
<l>Of brightest glory, when on board,</l>
<l>Breathing a prayer for blessings, meet</l>
<l>For priest or warrior to repeat,</l>
<l>Then he and car-borne Lakshmaṇ bent,</l>
<l>Well-pleased, their heads, most reverent,</l>
<l>Their hands, with Sítá, having dipped,</l>
<l>As Scripture bids, and water sipped,</l>
<l>Farewell to wise Sumantra said,</l>
<l>And Guha, with the train he led.</l>
<l>So Ráma took, on board, his stand,</l>
<l>And urged the vessel from the land.</l>
<l>Then swift by vigorous arms impelled</l>
<l>Her onward course the vessel held,</l>
<l>And guided by the helmsman through</l>
<l>The dashing waves of Gangá flew.</l>
<l>Half way across the flood they came,</l>
<l>When Sítá, free from spot and blame,</l>
<l>Her reverent hands together pressed,</l>
<l>The Goddess of the stream addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">May the great chieftain here who springs</q></l>
<l>From Daśaratha, best of kings,</l>
<l>Protected by thy care, fulfil</l>
<l>His prudent father's royal will.</l>
<l>When in the forest he has spent</l>
<l>His fourteen years of banishment,</l>
<l>With his dear brother and with me</l>
<l>His home again my lord shall see.</l>
<l>Returning on that blissful day,</l>
<l>I will to thee mine offerings pay,</l>
<l>Dear Queen, whose waters gently flow,</l>
<l>Who canst all blessed gifts bestow.</l>
<l>For, three-pathed Queen, though wandering here,</l>
<l>Thy waves descend from Brahmá's sphere,</l>
<l>Spouse of the God o'er floods supreme,</l>
<l>Though rolling here thy glorious stream.</l>
<l>To thee, fair Queen, my head shall bend,</l>
<l>To thee shall hymns of praise ascend,</l>
<l>When my brave lord shall turn again,</l>
<l>And, joyful, o'er his kingdom reign.</l>
<l>To win thy grace, O Queen divine,</l>
<l>A hundred thousand fairest kine,</l>
<l>And precious robes and finest meal</l>
<l>Among the Bráhmans will I deal.</l>
<l>A hundred jars of wine shall flow,</l>
<l>When to my home, O Queen, I go;</l>
<l>With these, and flesh, and corn, and rice,</l>
<l>Will I, delighted, sacrifice.</l>
<l>Each hallowed spot, each holy shrine</l>
<l>That stands on these fair shores of thine,</l>
<l>Each fane and altar on thy banks</l>
<l>Shall share my offerings and thanks.</l>
<l>With me and Lakshmaṇ, free from harm,</l>
<l>May he the blameless, strong of arm,</l>
<l>Reseek Ayodhyá from the wild,</l>
<l><q rend="post">O blameless Lady undefiled!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As, praying for her husband's sake,</l>
<l>The faultless dame to Gangá spake,</l>
<l>To the right bank the vessel flew</l>
<l>With her whose heart was right and true.</l>
<l>Soon as the bark had crossed the wave,</l>
<l>The lion leader of the brave,</l>
<l>Leaving the vessel on the strand,</l>
<l>With wife and brother leapt to land.</l>
<l>Then Ráma thus the prince addressed</l>
<l>Who filled with joy Sumitrá's breast:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Be thine alike to guard and aid</q></l>
<l>In peopled spot, in lonely shade.</l>
<l>Do thou, Sumitrá's son, precede:</l>
<l>Let Sítá walk where thou shalt lead.</l>
<l>Behind you both my place shall be,</l>
<l>To guard the Maithil dame and thee.</l>
<l>For she, to woe a stranger yet,</l>
<l>No toil or grief till now has met;</l>
<l>The fair Videhan will assay</l>
<l>The pains of forest life to-day.</l>
<l>To-day her tender feet must tread</l>
<l>Rough rocky wilds around her spread:</l>
<l>No tilth is there, no gardens grow,</l>
<l><q rend="post">No crowding people come and go.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero ceased: and Lakshmaṇ led</l>
<l>Obedient to the words he said:</l>
<l>And Sítá followed him, and then</l>
<l>Came Raghu's pride, the lord of men.</l>
<l>With Sítá walking o'er the sand</l>
<l>They sought the forest, bow in hand,</l>
<l>But still their lingering glances threw</l>
<l>Where yet Sumantra stood in view.</l>
<l>Sumantra, when his watchful eye</l>
<l>The royal youths no more could spy,</l>
<l>Turned from the spot whereon he stood</l>
<l>Homeward with Guha from the wood.</l>
<pb n="157"/><anchor id="Pg157"/>
<l>Still on the brothers forced their way</l>
<l>Where sweet birds sang on every spray,</l>
<l>Though scarce the eye a path could find</l>
<l>Mid flowering trees where creepers twined.</l>
<l>Far on the princely brothers pressed,</l>
<l>And stayed their feet at length to rest</l>
<l>Beneath a fig tree's mighty shade</l>
<l>With countless pendent shoots displayed.</l>
<l>Reclining there a while at ease,</l>
<l>They saw, not far, beneath fair trees</l>
<l>A lake with many a lotus bright</l>
<l>That bore the name of Lovely Sight.</l>
<l>Ráma his wife's attention drew,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ's, to the charming view:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Look, brother, look how fair the flood</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Glows with the lotus, flower and bud!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They drank the water fresh and clear,</l>
<l>And with their shafts they slew a deer.</l>
<l>A fire of boughs they made in haste,</l>
<l>And in the flame the meat they placed.</l>
<l>So Raghu's sons with Sítá shared</l>
<l>The hunter's meal their hands prepared,</l>
<l>Then counselled that the spreading tree</l>
<l>Their shelter and their home should be.</l>

<head>Canto LIII. Ráma's Lament.</head>

<lg>
<l>When evening rites were duly paid,</l>
<l>Reclined beneath the leafy shade,</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ thus spake Ráma, best</l>
<l>Of those who glad a people's breast:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now the first night has closed the day</q></l>
<l>That saw us from our country stray,</l>
<l>And parted from the charioteer;</l>
<l>Yet grieve not thou, my brother dear.</l>
<l>Henceforth by night, when others sleep,</l>
<l>Must we our careful vigil keep,</l>
<l>Watching for Sítá's welfare thus,</l>
<l>For her dear life depends on us.</l>
<l>Bring me the leaves that lie around,</l>
<l>And spread them here upon the ground,</l>
<l>That we on lowly beds may lie,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And let in talk the night go by.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So on the ground with leaves o'erspread,</l>
<l>He who should press a royal bed,</l>
<l>Ráma with Lakshmaṇ thus conversed,</l>
<l>And many a pleasant tale rehearsed:</l>
<l><q>This night the king,</q> he cried, <q rend="pre">alas!</q></l>
<l>In broken sleep will sadly pass.</l>
<l>Kaikeyí now content should be,</l>
<l>For mistress of her wish is she.</l>
<l>So fiercely she for empire yearns,</l>
<l>That when her Bharat home returns,</l>
<l>She in her greed, may even bring</l>
<l>Destruction on our lord the king.</l>
<l>What can he do, in feeble eld,</l>
<l>Reft of all aid and me expelled,</l>
<l>His soul enslaved by love, a thrall</l>
<l>Obedient to Kaikeyí's call?</l>
<l>As thus I muse upon his woe</l>
<l>And all his wisdoms overthrow,</l>
<l>Love is, methinks, of greater might</l>
<l>To stir the heart than gain and right.</l>
<l>For who, in wisdom's lore untaught,</l>
<l>Could by a beauty's prayer be bought</l>
<l>To quit his own obedient son,</l>
<l>Who loves him, as my sire has done!</l>
<l>Bharat, Kaikeyí's child, alone</l>
<l>Will, with his wife, enjoy the throne,</l>
<l>And blissfully his rule maintain</l>
<l>O'er happy Kośala's domain.</l>
<l>To Bharat's single lot will fall</l>
<l>The kingdom and the power and all,</l>
<l>When fails the king from length of days,</l>
<l>And Ráma in the forest strays.</l>
<l>Whoe'er, neglecting right and gain,</l>
<l>Lets conquering love his soul enchain,</l>
<l>To him, like Daśaratha's lot,</l>
<l>Comes woe with feet that tarry not.</l>
<l>Methinks at last the royal dame,</l>
<l>Dear Lakshmaṇ, has secured her aim,</l>
<l>To see at once her husband dead,</l>
<l>Her son enthroned, and Ráma fled.</l>
<l>Ah me! I fear, lest borne away</l>
<l>By frenzy of success, she slay</l>
<l>Kauśalyá, through her wicked hate</l>
<l>Of me, bereft, disconsolate;</l>
<l>Or her who aye for me has striven</l>
<l>Sumitrá, to devotion given.</l>
<l>Hence, Lakshmaṇ, to Ayodhyá speed,</l>
<l>Returning in the hour of need.</l>
<l>With Sítá I my steps will bend</l>
<l>Where Daṇḍak's mighty woods extend.</l>
<l>No guardian has Kauśalyá now:</l>
<l>O, be her friend and guardian thou.</l>
<l>Strong hate may vile Kaikeyí lead</l>
<l>To many a base unrighteous deed,</l>
<l>Treading my mother 'neath her feet</l>
<l>When Bharat holds the royal seat.</l>
<l>Sure in some antenatal time</l>
<l>Were children, by Kauśalyá's crime,</l>
<l>Torn from their mothers' arms away,</l>
<l>And hence she mourns this evil day.</l>
<l>She for her child no toil would spare</l>
<l>Tending me long with pain and care;</l>
<l>Now in the hour of fruitage she</l>
<l>Has lost that son, ah, woe is me.</l>
<l>O Lakshmaṇ, may no matron e'er</l>
<l>A son so doomed to sorrow bear</l>
<l>As I, my mother's heart who rend</l>
<l>With anguish that can never end.</l>
<l>The Sáriká,<note place="foot">The <hi rend='italic'>Mainá</hi> or Gracula religiosa,
a favourite cage-bird, easily taught to talk.</note> methinks, possessed</l>
<l>More love than glows in Ráma's breast.</l>
<l>Who, as the tale is told to us,</l>
<l>Addressed the stricken parrot thus:</l>
<pb n="158"/><anchor id="Pg158"/>
<l><q rend="pre">Parrot, the capturer's talons tear,</q></l>
<l>While yet alone thou flutterest there,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Before his mouth has closed on me:</q></l>
<l>So cried the bird, herself to free.</l>
<l>Reft of her son, in childless woe,</l>
<l>My mother's tears for ever flow:</l>
<l>Ill-fated, doomed with grief to strive,</l>
<l>What aid can she from me derive?</l>
<l>Pressed down by care, she cannot rise</l>
<l>From sorrow's flood wherein she lies.</l>
<l>In righteous wrath my single arm</l>
<l>Could, with my bow, protect from harm</l>
<l>Ayodhyá's town and all the earth:</l>
<l>But what is hero prowess worth?</l>
<l>Lest breaking duty's law I sin,</l>
<l>And lose the heaven I strive to win,</l>
<l>The forest life today I choose,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And kingly state and power refuse.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus mourning in that lonely spot</l>
<l>The troubled chief bewailed his lot,</l>
<l>And filled with tears, his eyes ran o'er;</l>
<l>Then silent sat, and spake no more.</l>
<l>To him, when ceased his loud lament,</l>
<l>Like fire whose brilliant might is spent,</l>
<l>Or the great sea when sleeps the wave,</l>
<l>Thus Lakshmaṇ consolation gave:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Chief of the brave who bear the bow,</q></l>
<l>E'en now Ayodhyá, sunk in woe,</l>
<l>By thy departure reft of light</l>
<l>Is gloomy as the moonless night.</l>
<l>Unfit it seems that thou, O chief,</l>
<l>Shouldst so afflict thy soul with grief,</l>
<l>So with thou Sítá's heart consign</l>
<l>To deep despair as well as mine.</l>
<l>Not I, O Raghu's son, nor she</l>
<l>Could live one hour deprived of thee:</l>
<l>We were, without thine arm to save,</l>
<l>Like fish deserted by the wave.</l>
<l>Although my mother dear to meet,</l>
<l>Śatrughna, and the king, were sweet,</l>
<l>On them, or heaven, to feed mine eye</l>
<l><q rend="post">Were nothing, if thou wert not by.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sitting at ease, their glances fell</l>

<lg>
<l>So there that night the heroes spent</l>
<l>Under the boughs that o'er them bent,</l>
<l>And when the sun his glory spread,</l>
<l>Upstarting, from the place they sped.</l>
<l>On to that spot they made their way,</l>
<l>Through the dense wood that round them lay,</l>
<l>Where Yamuná's<note place="foot">The Jumna.</note> swift waters glide</l>
<l>To blend with Gangá's holy tide.</l>
<l>Charmed with the prospect ever new</l>
<l>The glorious heroes wandered through</l>
<l>Full many a spot of pleasant ground,</l>
<l>Rejoicing as they gazed around,</l>
<l>With eager eye and heart at ease,</l>
<l>On countless sorts of flowery trees.</l>
<l>And now the day was half-way sped</l>
<l>When thus to Lakshmaṇ Ráma said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">There, there, dear brother, turn thine eyes;</q></l>
<l>See near Prayág<note place="foot">The Hindu name of Allahabad.</note>
that smoke arise:</l>
<l>The banner of our Lord of Flames</l>
<l>The dwelling of some saint proclaims.</l>
<l>Near to the place our steps we bend</l>
<l>Where Yamuná and Gangá blend.</l>
<l>I hear and mark the deafening roar</l>
<l>When chafing floods together pour.</l>
<l>See, near us on the ground are left</l>
<l>Dry logs, by labouring woodmen cleft,</l>
<l>And the tall trees, that blossom near</l>
<l><q rend="post">Saint Bharadvája's home, appear.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bow-armed princes onward passed,</l>
<l>And as the sun was sinking fast</l>
<l>They reached the hermit's dwelling, set</l>
<l>Near where the rushing waters met.</l>
<l>The presence of the warrior scared</l>
<l>The deer and birds as on he fared,</l>
<l>And struck them with unwonted awe:</l>
<l>Then Bharadvája's cot they saw.</l>
<l>The high-souled hermit soon they found</l>
<l>Girt by his dear disciples round:</l>
<l>Calm saint, whose vows had well been wrought,</l>
<l>Whose fervent rites keen sight had bought.</l>
<l>Duly had flames of worship blazed</l>
<l>When Ráma on the hermit gazed:</l>
<l>His suppliant hands the hero raised,</l>
<l>Drew nearer to the holy man</l>
<l>With his companions, and began,</l>
<l>Declaring both his name and race</l>
<l>And why they sought that distant place:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Saint, Daśaratha's children we,</q></l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ, come to thee.</l>
<l>This my good wife from Janak springs,</l>
<l>The best of fair Videha's kings;</l>
<l>Through lonely wilds, a faultless dame,</l>
<l>To this pure grove with me she came.</l>
<l>My younger brother follows still</l>
<l>Me banished by my father's will:</l>
<l>Sumitrá's son, bound by a vow,—</l>
<l>He roams the wood beside me now.</l>
<l>Sent by my father forth to rove,</l>
<l>We seek, O Saint, some holy grove,</l>
<l>Where lives of hermits we may lead,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And upon fruits and berries feed.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Bharadvája, prudent-souled,</l>
<l>Had heard the prince his tale unfold,</l>
<l>Water he bade them bring, a bull,</l>
<l>And honour-gifts in dishes full,</l>
<pb n="159"/><anchor id="Pg159"/>
<l>And drink and food of varied taste,</l>
<l>Berries and roots, before him placed,</l>
<l>And then the great ascetic showed</l>
<l>A cottage for the guests' abode.</l>
<l>The saint these honours gladly paid</l>
<l>To Ráma who had thither strayed,</l>
<l>Then compassed sat by birds and deer</l>
<l>And many a hermit resting near.</l>
<l>The prince received the service kind,</l>
<l>And sat him down rejoiced in mind.</l>
<l>Then Bharadvája silence broke,</l>
<l>And thus the words of duty spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Kakutstha's royal son, that thou</q></l>
<l>Hadst sought this grove I knew ere now.</l>
<l>Mine ears have heard thy story, sent</l>
<l>Without a sin to banishment.</l>
<l>Behold, O Prince, this ample space</l>
<l>Near where the mingling floods embrace,</l>
<l>Holy, and beautiful, and clear:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Dwell with us, and be happy here.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Bharadvája thus addressed,</l>
<l>Ráma whose kind and tender breast</l>
<l>All living things would bless and save,</l>
<l>In gracious words his answer gave:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">My honoured lord, this tranquil spot,</q></l>
<l>Fair home of hermits, suits me not:</l>
<l>For all the neighbouring people here</l>
<l>Will seek us when they know me near:</l>
<l>With eager wish to look on me,</l>
<l>And the Videhan dame to see,</l>
<l>A crowd of rustics will intrude</l>
<l>Upon the holy solitude.</l>
<l>Provide, O gracious lord, I pray,</l>
<l>Some quiet home that lies away,</l>
<l>Where my Videhan spouse may dwell</l>
<l><q rend="post">Tasting the bliss deserved so well.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hermit heard the prayer he made:</l>
<l>A while in earnest thought he stayed,</l>
<l>And then in words like these expressed</l>
<l>His answer to the chief's request:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ten leagues away there stands a hill</q></l>
<l>Where thou mayst live, if such thy will:</l>
<l>A holy mount, exceeding fair;</l>
<l>Great saints have made their dwelling there:</l>
<l>There great Langúrs<note place="foot">The Langúr is a large monkey.</note>
in thousands play,</l>
<l>And bears amid the thickets stray;</l>
<l>Wide-known by Chitrakúṭa's name,</l>
<l>It rivals Gandhamádan's<note place="foot">A mountain said to lie to the east of
Meru.</note> fame.</l>
<l>Long as the man that hill who seeks</l>
<l>Gazes upon its sacred peaks,</l>
<l>To holy things his soul he gives</l>
<l>And pure from thought of evil lives.</l>
<l>There, while a hundred autumns fled,</l>
<l>Has many a saint with hoary head</l>
<l>Spent his pure life, and won the prize,</l>
<l>By deep devotion, in the skies:</l>
<l>Best home, I ween, if such retreat,</l>
<l>Far from the ways of men, be sweet:</l>
<l>Or let thy years of exile flee</l>
<l><q rend="post">Here in this hermitage with me.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Bharadvája spake, and trained</l>
<l>In lore of duty, entertained</l>
<l>The princes and the dame, and pressed</l>
<l>His friendly gifts on every guest.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to Prayág the hero went,</l>
<l>Thus saw the saint preëminent,</l>
<l>And varied speeches heard and said:</l>
<l>Then holy night o'er heaven was spread.</l>
<l>And Ráma took, by toil oppressed,</l>
<l>With Sítá and his brother, rest;</l>
<l>And so the night, with sweet content,</l>
<l>In Bharadvája's grove was spent.</l>
<l>But when the dawn dispelled the night,</l>
<l>Ráma approached the anchorite,</l>
<l>And thus addressed the holy sire</l>
<l>Whose glory shone like kindled fire:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Well have we spent, O truthful Sage,</q></l>
<l>The night within thy hermitage:</l>
<l>Now let my lord his guests permit</l>
<l><q rend="post">For their new home his grove to quit.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, as he saw the morning break,</l>
<l>In answer Bharadvája spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Go forth to Chitrakúṭa's hill,</q></l>
<l>Where berries grow, and sweets distil:</l>
<l>Full well, I deem, that home will suit</l>
<l>Thee, Ráma, strong and resolute.</l>
<l>Go forth, and Chitrakúṭa seek,</l>
<l>Famed mountain of the Varied Peak.</l>
<l>In the wild woods that gird him round</l>
<l>All creatures of the chase are found:</l>
<l>Thou in the glades shalt see appear</l>
<l>Vast herds of elephants and deer.</l>
<l>With Sítá there shalt thou delight</l>
<l>To gaze upon the woody height;</l>
<l>There with expanding heart to look</l>
<l>On river, table-land, and brook,</l>
<l>And see the foaming torrent rave</l>
<l>Impetuous from the mountain cave.</l>
<l>Auspicious hill! where all day long</l>
<l>The lapwing's cry, the Koïl's song</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Make all who listen gay:</l>
<l>Where all is fresh and fair to see,</l>

<lg>
<l>The princely tamers of their foes</l>
<l>Thus passed the night in calm repose,</l>
<l>Then to the hermit having bent</l>
<l>With reverence, on their way they went.</l>
<l>High favour Bharadvája showed,</l>
<l>And blessed them ready for the road.</l>
<pb n="160"/><anchor id="Pg160"/>
<l>With such fond looks as fathers throw</l>
<l>On their own sons, before they go.</l>
<l>Then spake the saint with glory bright</l>
<l>To Ráma peerless in his might:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">First, lords of men, direct your feet</q></l>
<l>Where Yamuná and Gangá meet;</l>
<l>Then to the swift Kálindí<note place="foot">Another name of the Jumna, daughter
of the Sun.</note> go,</l>
<l>Whose westward waves to Gangá flow.</l>
<l>When thou shalt see her lovely shore</l>
<l>Worn by their feet who hasten o'er,</l>
<l>Then, Raghu's son, a raft prepare,</l>
<l>And cross the Sun born river there.</l>
<l>Upon her farther bank a tree,</l>
<l>Near to the landing wilt thou see.</l>
<l>The blessed source of varied gifts,</l>
<l>There her green boughs that Fig-tree lifts:</l>
<l>A tree where countless birds abide,</l>
<l>By Śyáma's name known far and wide.</l>
<l>Sítá, revere that holy shade:</l>
<l>There be thy prayers for blessing prayed.</l>
<l>Thence for a league your way pursue,</l>
<l>And a dark wood shall meet your view,</l>
<l>Where tall bamboos their foliage show,</l>
<l>The Gum-tree and the Jujube grow.</l>
<l>To Chitrakúṭa have I oft</l>
<l>Trodden that path so smooth and soft,</l>
<l>Where burning woods no traveller scare,</l>
<l><q rend="post">But all is pleasant, green, and fair.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When thus the guests their road had learned,</l>
<l>Back to his cot the hermit turned,</l>
<l>And Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, Sítá paid</l>
<l>Their reverent thanks for courteous aid.</l>
<l>Thus Ráma spake to Lakshmaṇ, when</l>
<l>The saint had left the lords of men:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Great store of bliss in sooth is ours</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">On whom his love the hermit showers.</q></l>
<l>As each to other wisely talked,</l>
<l>The lion lords together walked</l>
<l>On to Kálindí's woody shore;</l>
<l>And gentle Sítá went before.</l>
<l>They reached that flood, whose waters flee</l>
<l>With rapid current to the sea;</l>
<l>Their minds a while to thought they gave</l>
<l>And counselled how to cross the wave.</l>
<l>At length, with logs together laid,</l>
<l>A mighty raft the brothers made.</l>
<l>Then dry bamboos across were tied,</l>
<l>And grass was spread from side to side.</l>
<l>And the great hero Lakshmaṇ brought</l>
<l>Cane and Rose-Apple boughs and wrought,</l>
<l>Trimming the branches smooth and neat,</l>
<l>For Sítá's use a pleasant seat.</l>
<l>And Ráma placed thereon his dame</l>
<l>Touched with a momentary shame,</l>
<l>Resembling in her glorious mien</l>
<l>All-thought-surpassing Fortune's Queen.</l>
<l>Then Ráma hastened to dispose,</l>
<l>Each in its place, the skins and bows,</l>
<l>And by the fair Videhan laid</l>
<l>The coats, the ornaments, and spade.</l>
<l>When Sítá thus was set on board,</l>
<l>And all their gear was duly stored,</l>
<l>The heroes each with vigorous hand,</l>
<l>Pushed off the raft and left the land.</l>
<l>When half its way the raft had made,</l>
<l>Thus Sítá to Kálindí prayed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Goddess, whose flood I traverse now,</q></l>
<l>Grant that my lord may keep his vow.</l>
<l>For thee shall bleed a thousand kine,</l>
<l>A hundred jars shall pour their wine,</l>
<l>When Ráma sees that town again</l>
<l><q rend="post">Where old Ikshváku's children reign.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to Kálindí's stream she sued</l>
<l>And prayed in suppliant attitude.</l>
<l>Then to the river's bank the dame,</l>
<l>Fervent in supplication, came.</l>
<l>They left the raft that brought them o'er,</l>
<l>And the thick wood that clothed the shore,</l>
<l>And to the Fig-tree Śyáma made</l>
<l>Their way, so cool with verdant shade.</l>
<l>Then Sítá viewed that best of trees,</l>
<l>And reverent spake in words like these:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Hail, hail, O mighty tree! Allow</q></l>
<l>My husband to complete his vow;</l>
<l>Let us returning, I entreat,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Kauśalyá and Sumitrá meet.</q></l>
<l>Then with her hands together placed</l>
<l>Around the tree she duly paced.</l>
<l>When Ráma saw his blameless spouse</l>
<l>A suppliant under holy boughs,</l>
<l>The gentle darling of his heart,</l>
<l>He thus to Lakshmaṇ spake apart:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Brother, by thee our way be led;</q></l>
<l>Let Sítá close behind thee tread:</l>
<l>I, best of men, will grasp my bow,</l>
<l>And hindmost of the three will go.</l>
<l>What fruits soe'er her fancy take,</l>
<l>Or flowers half hidden in the brake,</l>
<l>For Janak's child forget not thou</l>
<l><q rend="post">To gather from the brake or bough.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus on they fared. The tender dame</l>
<l>Asked Ráma, as they walked, the name</l>
<l>Of every shrub that blossoms bore,</l>
<l>Creeper, and tree unseen before:</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ fetched, at Sítá's prayer,</l>
<l>Boughs of each tree with clusters fair.</l>
<l>Then Janak's daughter joyed to see</l>
<l>The sand-discoloured river flee,</l>
<l>Where the glad cry of many a bird,</l>
<l>The sáras and the swan, was heard.</l>
<l>A league the brothers travelled through</l>
<l>The forest noble game they slew:</l>
<l>Beneath the trees their meal they dressed</l>
<l>And sat them down to eat and rest.</l>
<l>A while in that delightful shade</l>

<l>Where peacocks screamed and monkeys played,</l>
<pb n="161"/><anchor id="Pg161"/>

<l>Then Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, Sítá, each</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lakshmaṇ, the chief whose arrows laid</l>

<l>Then glorious Lakshmaṇ took the buck</l>
<l>His arrow in the wood had struck;</l>
<l>Bearing his mighty load he came,</l>
<l>And laid it in the kindled flame.</l>
<pb n="162"/><anchor id="Pg162"/>
<l>Soon as he saw the meat was done,</l>

<l>And Rudra's right, and Vishṇu's too,</l>
<l>Nor wonted blessings, to protect</l>
<l>Their new-built home, did he neglect.</l>
<l>With voice repressed he breathed the prayer,</l>
<l>Bathed duly in the river fair,</l>
<l>And gave good offerings that remove</l>
<l>The stain of sin, as texts approve.</l>
<l>And many an altar there he made,</l>
<l>And shrines, to suit the holy shade,</l>
<l>All decked with woodland chaplets sweet,</l>

<l>With muttered prayer, as texts require,</l>

<head>Canto LVII. Sumantra's Return.</head>

<lg>
<l>When Ráma reached the southern bank,</l>
<l>King Guha's heart with sorrow sank:</l>
<l>He with Sumantra talked, and spent</l>
<l>With his deep sorrow, homeward went.</l>
<l>Sumantra, as the king decreed,</l>
<l>Yoked to the car each noble steed,</l>
<l>And to Ayodhyá's city sped</l>
<l>With his sad heart disquieted.</l>
<l>On lake and brook and scented grove</l>
<l>His glances fell, as on he drove:</l>
<l>City and village came in view</l>
<l>As o'er the road his coursers flew.</l>
<l>On the third day the charioteer,</l>
<l>When now the hour of night was near,</l>
<l>Came to Ayodhyá's gate, and found</l>
<l>The city all in sorrow drowned.</l>
<l>To him, in spirit quite cast down,</l>
<l>Forsaken seemed the silent town,</l>
<l>And by the rush of grief oppressed</l>
<l>He pondered in his mournful breast:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Is all Ayodhyá burnt with grief,</q></l>
<l>Steed, elephant, and man, and chief?</l>
<l>Does her loved Ráma's exile so</l>
<l><q rend="post">Afflict her with the fires of woe?</q></l>
<l>Thus as he mused, his steeds flew fast,</l>
<l>And swiftly through the gate he passed.</l>
<l>On drove the charioteer, and then</l>
<l>In hundreds, yea in thousands, men</l>
<l>Ran to the car from every side,</l>
<l>And, <q>Ráma, where is Ráma?</q> cried.</l>
<l>Sumantra said: <q rend="pre">My chariot bore</q></l>
<l>The duteous prince to Gangá's shore;</l>
<l>I left him there at his behest,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And homeward to Ayodhyá pressed.</q></l>
<l>Soon as the anxious people knew</l>
<l>That he was o'er the flood they drew</l>
<l>Deep sighs, and crying, Ráma! all</l>
<l>Wailed, and big tears began to fall.</l>
<l>He heard the mournful words prolonged,</l>
<l>As here and there the people thronged:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Woe, woe for us, forlorn, undone,</q></l>
<l>No more to look on Raghu's son!</l>
<l>His like again we ne'er shall see,</l>
<l>Of heart so true, of hand so free,</l>
<l>In gifts, in gatherings for debate,</l>
<l>When marriage pomps we celebrate,</l>
<l>What should we do? What earthly thing</l>
<l><q rend="post">Can rest, or hope, or pleasure bring?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus the sad town, which Ráma kept</l>
<l>As a kind father, wailed and wept.</l>
<l>Each mansion, as the car went by,</l>
<l>Sent forth a loud and bitter cry,</l>
<l>As to the window every dame,</l>
<l>Mourning for banished Ráma, came.</l>
<l>As his sad eyes with tears o'erflowed,</l>
<l>He sped along the royal road</l>
<l>To Daśaratha's high abode.</l>
<l>There leaping down his car he stayed;</l>
<l>Within the gates his way he made;</l>
<l>Through seven broad courts he onward hied</l>
<l>Where people thronged on every side.</l>
<l>From each high terrace, wild with woe,</l>
<l>The royal ladies flocked below:</l>
<pb n="163"/><anchor id="Pg163"/>
<l>He heard them talk in gentle tone,</l>
<l>As each for Ráma made her moan:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What will the charioteer reply</q></l>
<l>To Queen Kauśalyá's eager cry?</l>
<l>With Ráma from the gates he went;</l>
<l>Homeward alone, his steps are bent.</l>
<l>Hard is a life with woe distressed,</l>
<l>But difficult to win is rest,</l>
<l>If, when her son is banished, still</l>
<l><q rend="post">She lives beneath her load of ill.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such was the speech Sumantra heard</l>
<l>From them whom grief unfeigned had stirred.</l>
<l>As fires of anguish burnt him through,</l>
<l>Swift to the monarch's hall he drew,</l>
<l>Past the eighth court; there met his sight,</l>
<l>The sovereign in his palace bright,</l>
<l>Still weeping for his son, forlorn,</l>
<l>Pale, faint, and all with sorrow worn.</l>
<l>As there he sat, Sumantra bent</l>
<l>And did obeisance reverent,</l>
<l>And to the king repeated o'er</l>
<l>The message he from Ráma bore.</l>
<l>The monarch heard, and well-nigh brake</l>
<l>His heart, but yet no word he spake:</l>
<l>Fainting to earth he fell, and dumb,</l>
<l>By grief for Ráma overcome.</l>
<l>Rang through the hall a startling cry,</l>
<l>And women's arms were tossed on high,</l>
<l>When, with his senses all astray,</l>
<l>Upon the ground the monarch lay.</l>
<l>Kauśalyá, with Sumitrá's aid,</l>
<l>Raised from the ground her lord dismayed:</l>
<l><q>Sire, of high fate,</q> she cried, <q rend="pre">O, why</q></l>
<l>Dost thou no single word reply</l>
<l>To Ráma's messenger who brings</l>
<l>News of his painful wanderings?</l>
<l>The great injustice done, art thou</l>
<l>Shame-stricken for thy conduct now?</l>
<l>Rise up, and do thy part: bestow</l>
<l>Comfort and help in this our woe.</l>
<l>Speak freely, King; dismiss thy fear,</l>
<l>For Queen Kaikeyí stands not near,</l>
<l>Afraid of whom thou wouldst not seek</l>
<l><q rend="post">Tidings of Ráma: freely speak.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the sad queen had ended so,</l>
<l>She sank, insatiate in her woe,</l>
<l>And prostrate lay upon the ground,</l>
<l>While her faint voice by sobs was drowned.</l>
<l>When all the ladies in despair</l>
<l>Saw Queen Kauśalyá wailing there,</l>
<l>And the poor king oppressed with pain,</l>
<l>They flocked around and wept again.</l>

<head>Canto LVIII. Ráma's Message.</head>

<lg>
<l>The king a while had senseless lain,</l>
<l>When care brought memory back again.</l>
<l>Then straight he called, the news to hear</l>
<l>Of Ráma, for the charioteer,</l>
<l>With reverent hand to hand applied</l>
<l>He waited by the old man's side,</l>
<l>Whose mind with anguish was distraught</l>
<l>Like a great elephant newly caught.</l>
<l>The king with bitter pain distressed</l>
<l>The faithful charioteer addressed,</l>
<l>Who, sad of mien, with flooded eye,</l>
<l>And dust upon his limbs, stood by:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Where will be Ráma's dwelling now</q></l>
<l>At some tree's foot, beneath the bough;</l>
<l>Ah, what will be the exile's food,</l>
<l>Bred up with kind solicitude?</l>
<l>Can he, long lapped in pleasant rest,</l>
<l>Unmeet for pain, by pain oppressed,</l>
<l>Son of earth's king, his sad night spend</l>
<l>Earth-couched, as one that has no friend?</l>
<l>Behind him, when abroad he sped,</l>
<l>Cars, elephant, and foot were led:</l>
<l>Then how shall Ráma dwell afar</l>
<l>In the wild woods where no men are?</l>
<l>How, tell me, did the princes there,</l>
<l>With Sítá good and soft and fair,</l>
<l>Alighting from the chariot, tread</l>
<l>The forest wilds around them spread?</l>
<l>A happy lot is thine, I ween,</l>
<l>Whose eyes my two dear sons have seen</l>
<l>Seeking on foot the forest shade,</l>
<l>Like the bright Twins to view displayed,</l>
<l>The heavenly Aśvins, when they seek</l>
<l>The woods that hang 'neath Mandar's peak.</l>
<l>What words, Sumantra, quickly tell,</l>
<l>From Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, Sítá fell?</l>
<l>How in the wood did Ráma eat?</l>
<l>What was his bed, and what his seat?</l>
<l>Full answer to my questions give,</l>
<l>For I on thy replies shall live,</l>
<l>As with the saints Yayáti held</l>
<l><q rend="post">Sweet converse, from the skies expelled.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Urged by the lord of men to speak,</l>
<l>Whose sobbing voice came faint and weak,</l>
<l>Thus he, while tears his utterance broke,</l>
<l>In answer to the monarch spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Hear then the words that Ráma said,</q></l>
<l>Resolved in duty's path to tread.</l>
<l>Joining his hands, his head he bent,</l>

<l>And add this word: <q rend="pre">O Queen, pursue</q></l>
<l>Thy vows with faithful heart and true;</l>
<l>And ever at due season turn</l>
<l>Where holy fires of worship burn.</l>
<l>And, lady, on our lord bestow</l>

<l>Such honour as to Gods we owe.</l>
<l>Be kind to every queen: let pride</l>

<l>Kaikeyí, by respect and praise.</l>

<l><q rend="pre">As ruling prince thy care be shown</q></l>

<l>He is the cause, the king: poor slave</l>

<l>Let right or wrong the motive be,</l>

<l>Whether the exile were decreed</l>
<l>Through foolish faith or guilty greed,</l>
<l>For promises or empire, still</l>
<l>The king has wrought a grievous ill.</l>
<l>Grant that the Lord of all saw fit</l>
<l>To prompt the deed and sanction it,</l>
<l>In Ráma's life no cause I see</l>
<l>For which the king should bid him flee.</l>
<l>His blinded eyes refused to scan</l>
<l>The guilt and folly of the plan,</l>

<l>My brother Ráma, Raghu's son,</l>

<l>The love of men how can he win,</l>
<l>Deserting, by the cruel sin,</l>

<l>Drear is each grove and garden now,</l>
<l>Dry every blossom on the bough.</l>
<l>Each beast is still, no serpents crawl:</l>
<l>A lethargy of woe on all.</l>
<l>The very wood is silent: crushed</l>
<l>With grief for Ráma, all is hushed.</l>
<l>Fair blossoms from the water born,</l>
<l>Gay garlands that the earth adorn,</l>

<l>As Queen Kauśalyá, trembling much,</l>
<l>As blighted by a goblin's touch,</l>
<l>Still lying prostrate, half awoke</l>
<l>To consciousness, 'twas thus she spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Bear me away, Sumantra, far,</q></l>
<l>Where Ráma, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ are.</l>
<l>Bereft of them I have no power</l>
<l>To linger on a single hour.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His utterance choked by tears that rolled</l>
<l>Down from their fountains uncontrolled,</l>
<l>With suppliant hands the charioteer</l>
<l>Thus spake, the lady's heart to cheer:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Dismiss thy grief, despair, and dread</q></l>
<l>That fills thy soul, of sorrow bred,</l>
<l>For pain and anguish thrown aside,</l>
<l>Will Ráma in the wood abide.</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ, with unfailing care</l>
<l>Will guard the feet of Ráma there,</l>
<l>Earning, with governed sense, the prize</l>
<l>That waits on duty in the skies.</l>
<l>And Sítá in the wild as well</l>
<l>As in her own dear home will dwell;</l>
<l>To Ráma all her heart she gives,</l>
<l>And free from doubt and terror lives.</l>
<l>No faintest sign of care or woe</l>
<l>The features of the lady show:</l>
<l>Methinks Videha's pride was made</l>
<l>For exile in the forest shade.</l>
<l>E'en as of old she used to rove</l>
<l>Delighted in the city's grove,</l>
<l>Thus, even thus she joys to tread</l>
<l>The woodlands uninhabited.</l>
<l>Like a young child, her face as fair</l>
<l>As the young moon, she wanders there.</l>
<l>What though in lonely woods she stray</l>
<l>Still Ráma is her joy and stay:</l>
<l>All his the heart no sorrow bends,</l>
<l>Her very life on him depends.</l>
<l>For, if her lord she might not see,</l>
<l>Ayodhyá like the wood would be.</l>
<l>She bids him, as she roams, declare</l>
<l>The names of towns and hamlets there,</l>
<l>Marks various trees that meet her eye,</l>
<l>And many a brook that hurries by,</l>
<l>And Janak's daughter seems to roam</l>
<l>One little league away from home</l>
<l>When Ráma or his brother speaks</l>
<l>And gives the answer that she seeks.</l>
<l>This, Lady, I remember well,</l>
<l>Nor angry words have I to tell:</l>
<l>Reproaches at Kaikeyí shot,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Such, Queen, my mind remembers not.</q></l>
<l>The speech when Sítá's wrath was high,</l>
<l>Sumantra passed in silence by,</l>
<l>That so his pleasant words might cheer</l>
<l>With sweet report Kauśalyá's ear.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Her moonlike beauty suffers not</q></l>
<l>Though winds be rude and suns be hot:</l>
<l>The way, the danger, and the toil</l>
<l>Her gentle lustre may not soil.</l>
<l>Like the red lily's leafy crown</l>
<l>Or as the fair full moon looks down,</l>
<l>So the Videhan lady's face</l>
<l>Still shines with undiminished grace.</l>
<l>What if the borrowed colours throw</l>
<l>O'er her fine feet no rosy glow,</l>
<l>Still with their natural tints they spread</l>
<l>A lotus glory where they tread.</l>
<l>In sportive grace she walks the ground</l>
<l>And sweet her chiming anklets sound.</l>
<l>No jewels clasp the faultless limb:</l>
<l>She leaves them all for love of him.</l>
<l>If in the woods her gentle eye</l>
<l>A lion sees, or tiger nigh,</l>
<l>Or elephant, she fears no ill</l>
<l>For Ráma's arm supports her still.</l>
<l>No longer be their fate deplored,</l>
<l>Nor thine, nor that of Kośal's lord,</l>
<l>For conduct such as theirs shall buy</l>
<l>Wide glory that can never die.</l>
<l>For casting grief and care away,</l>
<l>Delighting in the forest, they</l>
<l>With joyful spirits, blithe and gay,</l>
<l>Set forward on the ancient way</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where mighty saints have led:</l>

<lg>
<l>When, best of all who give delight,</l>
<l>Her Ráma wandered far from sight,</l>
<l>Kauśalyá weeping, sore distressed,</l>
<l>The king her husband thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thy name, O Monarch, far and wide</q></l>
<l>Through the three worlds is glorified:</l>
<l>Yet Ráma's is the pitying mind,</l>
<l>His speed is true, his heart is kind.</l>
<l>How will thy sons, good lord, sustain</l>
<l>With Sítá, all their care and pain?</l>
<l>How in the wild endure distress,</l>
<l>Nursed in the lap of tenderness?</l>
<l>How will the dear Videhan bear</l>
<l>The heat and cold when wandering there</l>
<l>Bred in the bliss of princely state,</l>
<l>So young and fair and delicate?</l>
<l>The large-eyed lady, wont to eat</l>
<l>The best of finely seasoned meat—</l>
<l>How will she now her life sustain</l>
<l>With woodland fare of self-sown grain?</l>
<l>Will she, with joys encompassed long,</l>
<l>Who loved the music and the song,</l>
<l>In the wild wood endure to hear</l>
<l>The ravening lion's voice of fear?</l>
<l>Where sleeps my strong-armed hero, where,</l>
<pb n="167"/><anchor id="Pg167"/>
<l>Like Lord Mahendra's standard, fair?</l>
<l>Where is, by Lakshmaṇ's side, his bed,</l>
<l>His club-like arm beneath his head?</l>
<l>When shall I see his flower-like eyes,</l>
<l>And face that with the lotus vies,</l>
<l>Feel his sweet lily breath, and view</l>
<l>His glorious hair and lotus hue?</l>
<l>The heart within my breast, I feel,</l>
<l>Is adamant or hardest steel,</l>
<l>Or, in a thousand fragments split,</l>
<l>The loss of him had shattered it,</l>
<l>When those I love, who should be blest,</l>
<l>Are wandering in the wood distressed,</l>
<l>Condemned their wretched lives to lead</l>
<l>In exile, by thy ruthless deed.</l>
<l>If, when the fourteen years are past,</l>
<l>Ráma reseeks his home at last,</l>
<l>I think not Bharat will consent</l>
<l>To yield the wealth and government.</l>
<l>At funeral feasts some mourners deal</l>
<l>To kith and kin the solemn meal,</l>
<l>And having duly fed them all</l>
<l>Some Bráhmans to the banquet call.</l>
<l>The best of Bráhmans, good and wise,</l>
<l>The tardy summoning despise,</l>
<l>And, equal to the Gods, disdain</l>
<l>Cups, e'en of Amrit, thus to drain.</l>
<l>Nay e'en when Bráhmans first have fed,</l>
<l>They loathe the meal for others spread,</l>
<l>And from the leavings turn with scorn,</l>
<l>As bulls avoid a fractured horn.</l>
<l>So Ráma, sovereign lord of men,</l>
<l>Will spurn the sullied kingship then:</l>
<l>He born the eldest and the best,</l>
<l>His younger's leavings will detest,</l>
<l>Turning from tasted food away,</l>
<l>As tigers scorn another's prey.</l>
<l>The sacred post is used not twice,</l>
<l>Nor elements, in sacrifice.</l>
<l>But once the sacred grass is spread,</l>
<l>But once with oil the flame is fed:</l>
<l>So Ráma's pride will ne'er receive</l>
<l>The royal power which others leave,</l>
<l>Like wine when tasteless dregs are left,</l>
<l>Or rites of Soma juice bereft.</l>
<l>Be sure the pride of Raghu's race</l>
<l>Will never stoop to such disgrace:</l>
<l>The lordly lion will not bear</l>
<l>That man should beard him in his lair.</l>
<l>Were all the worlds against him ranged</l>
<l>His dauntless soul were still unchanged:</l>
<l>He, dutiful, in duty strong,</l>
<l>Would purge the impious world from wrong.</l>
<l>Could not the hero, brave and bold,</l>
<l>The archer, with his shafts of gold,</l>
<l>Burn up the very seas, as doom</l>
<l>Will in the end all life consume?</l>
<l>Of lion's might, eyed like a bull,</l>
<l>A prince so brave and beautiful,</l>
<l>Thou hast with wicked hate pursued,</l>
<l>Like sea-born tribes who eat their brood.</l>
<l>If thou, O Monarch, hadst but known</l>
<l>The duty all the Twice-born own,</l>
<l>If the good laws had touched thy mind,</l>
<l>Which sages in the Scriptures find,</l>
<l>Thou ne'er hadst driven forth to pine</l>
<l>This brave, this duteous son of thine.</l>
<l>First on her lord the wife depends,</l>
<l>Next on her son and last on friends:</l>
<l>These three supports in life has she,</l>
<l>And not a fourth for her may be.</l>

<l>Reflected in his secret breast.</l>
<l>Fainting and sad, with woe distraught,</l>
<l>He wandered in a maze of thought;</l>
<l>At length the queller of the foe</l>
<l>Grew conscious, rallying from his woe.</l>
<l>When consciousness returned anew</l>
<l>Long burning sighs the monarch drew,</l>

<l>Kauśalyá standing by his side.</l>
<l>Back to his pondering soul was brought</l>
<l>The direful deed his hand had wrought,</l>

<l>His arrow at a sound was sent.</l>

<l>But soon by rankling grief oppressed</l>
<l>The king awoke from troubled rest,</l>
<l>And his sad heart was tried again</l>
<l>With anxious thought where all was pain.</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ's mournful fate</l>
<l>On Daśaratha, good and great</l>
<l>As Indra, pressed with crushing weight,</l>
<l>As when the demon's might assails</l>
<l>The Sun-God, and his glory pales.</l>
<l>Ere yet the sixth long night was spent,</l>
<l>Since Ráma to the woods was sent,</l>
<l>The king at midnight sadly thought</l>
<l>Of the old crime his hand had wrought,</l>
<l>And thus to Queen Kauśalyá cried</l>
<l>Who still for Ráma moaned and sighed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">If thou art waking, give, I pray,</q></l>
<l>Attention to the words I say.</l>
<l>Whate'er the conduct men pursue,</l>
<l>Be good or ill the acts they do,</l>

<l>Of wicked or of virtuous deed.</l>
<l>A heedless child we call the man</l>
<l>Whose feeble judgment fails to scan</l>
<l>The weight of what his hands may do,</l>
<l>Its lightness, fault, and merit too.</l>
<l>One lays the Mango garden low,</l>
<l>And bids the gay Paláśas grow:</l>
<l>Longing for fruit their bloom he sees,</l>
<l>But grieves when fruit should bend the trees.</l>
<l>Cut by my hand, my fruit-trees fell,</l>
<l>Paláśa trees I watered well.</l>
<l>My hopes this foolish heart deceive,</l>
<l>And for my banished son I grieve.</l>
<l>Kauśalyá, in my youthful prime</l>
<l>Armed with my bow I wrought the crime,</l>
<l>Proud of my skill, my name renowned,</l>
<l>An archer prince who shoots by sound.</l>
<l>The deed this hand unwitting wrought</l>
<l>This misery on my soul has brought,</l>

<l>And blindly drink the poison up.</l>
<l>As the unreasoning man may be</l>
<l>Charmed with the gay Paláśa tree,</l>
<l>I unaware have reaped the fruit</l>
<l>Of joying at a sound to shoot.</l>
<l>As regent prince I shared the throne,</l>
<l>Thou wast a maid to me unknown,</l>
<l>The early Rain-time duly came,</l>
<l>And strengthened love's delicious flame.</l>
<l>The sun had drained the earth that lay</l>

<l>Keen for the chase, in field or grove,</l>

<l>Some elephant by night to kill,</l>
<l>Some buffalo that came to drink,</l>

<l>E'en as the weapon smote his side,</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Why lights this shaft on one like me,</q></l>

<l>I came by night to fill my jar</l>
<l>From this lone stream where no men are.</l>

<l>Whom have I wronged, and knew it not?</l>
<l>Why should a boy so harmless feel</l>
<l>The vengeance of the winged steel?</l>
<l>Or who should slay the guiltless son</l>
<l>Of hermit sire who injures none,</l>
<l>Who dwells retired in woods, and there</l>
<l>Supports his life on woodland fare?</l>
<l>Ah me, ah me, why am I slain,</l>

<head>Canto LXIV. Dasaratha's Death.</head>

<lg>
<l>The son of Raghu to his queen</l>
<l>Thus far described the unequalled scene,</l>
<l>And, as the hermit's death he rued,</l>
<l>The mournful story thus renewed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The deed my heedless hand had wrought</q></l>
<l>Perplexed me with remorseful thought,</l>
<l>And all alone I pondered still</l>
<l>How kindly deed might salve the ill.</l>
<l>The pitcher from the ground I took,</l>
<l>And filled it from that fairest brook,</l>
<l>Then, by the path the hermit showed,</l>
<l>I reached his sainted sire's abode.</l>
<l>I came, I saw: the aged pair,</l>
<l>Feeble and blind, were sitting there,</l>
<l>Like birds with clipped wings, side by side,</l>
<l>With none their helpless steps to guide.</l>
<l>Their idle hours the twain beguiled</l>
<l>With talk of their returning child,</l>
<l>And still the cheering hope enjoyed,</l>
<l>The hope, alas, by me destroyed.</l>
<l>Then spoke the sage, as drawing near</l>
<l>The sound of footsteps reached his ear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Dear son, the water quickly bring;</q></l>
<l>Why hast thou made this tarrying?</l>
<l>Thy mother thirsts, and thou hast played,</l>
<l>And bathing in the brook delayed.</l>
<l>She weeps because thou camest not;</l>
<l>Haste, O my son, within the cot.</l>
<l>If she or I have ever done</l>
<l>A thing to pain thee, dearest son,</l>
<l>Dismiss the memory from thy mind:</l>
<l>A hermit thou, be good and kind.</l>
<l>On thee our lives, our all, depend:</l>
<l>Thou art thy friendless parents' friend.</l>
<l>The eyeless couple's eye art thou:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Then why so cold and silent now?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With sobbing voice and bosom wrung</l>
<l>I scarce could move my faltering tongue,</l>
<l>And with my spirit filled with dread</l>
<l>I looked upon the sage, and said,</l>
<l>While mind, and sense, and nerve I strung</l>
<l>To fortify my trembling tongue,</l>
<l>And let the aged hermit know</l>
<l>His son's sad fate, my fear and woe:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">High-minded Saint, not I thy child,</q></l>
<l>A warrior, Daśaratha styled.</l>
<l>I bear a grievous sorrow's weight</l>
<l>Born of a deed which good men hate.</l>
<l>My lord, I came to Sarjú's shore,</l>
<l>And in my hand my bow I bore</l>
<l>For elephant or beast of chase</l>
<l>That seeks by night his drinking place.</l>
<l>There from the stream a sound I heard</l>
<l>As if a jar the water stirred.</l>
<l>An elephant, I thought, was nigh:</l>
<l>I aimed, and let an arrow fly.</l>
<l>Swift to the place I made my way,</l>
<l>And there a wounded hermit lay</l>
<l>Gasping for breath: the deadly dart</l>
<l>Stood quivering in his youthful heart.</l>
<l>I hastened near with pain oppressed;</l>
<l>He faltered out his last behest.</l>
<l>And quickly, as he bade me do,</l>
<l>From his pierced side the shaft I drew.</l>
<l>I drew the arrow from the rent,</l>
<l>And up to heaven the hermit went,</l>
<l>Lamenting, as from earth he passed,</l>
<l>His aged parents to the last.</l>
<l>Thus, unaware, the deed was done:</l>
<l>My hand, unwitting, killed thy son.</l>
<l>For what remains, O, let me win</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thy pardon for my heedless sin.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the sad tale of sin I told</l>
<l>The hermit's grief was uncontrolled.</l>
<l>With flooded eyes, and sorrow-faint,</l>
<l>Thus spake the venerable saint:</l>
<l>I stood with hand to hand applied,</l>
<l>And listened as he spoke and sighed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">If thou, O King, hadst left unsaid</q></l>
<l>By thine own tongue this tale of dread,</l>
<l>Thy head for hideous guilt accursed</l>
<l>Had in a thousand pieces burst.</l>
<l>A hermit's blood by warrior spilt,</l>
<l>In such a case, with purposed guilt,</l>
<l>Down from his high estate would bring</l>
<l>Even the thunder's mighty King.</l>
<l>And he a dart who conscious sends</l>
<l>Against the devotee who spends</l>
<l>His pure life by the law of Heaven—</l>
<l>That sinner's head will split in seven.</l>
<l>Thou livest, for thy heedless hand</l>
<l>Has wrought a deed thou hast not planned,</l>
<l>Else thou and all of Raghu's line</l>
<l>Had perished by this act of thine.</l>
<l><q rend="post">Now guide us,</q> thus the hermit said,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Forth to the spot where he lies dead.</q></l>
<l>Guide us, this day, O Monarch, we</l>
<l>For the last time our son would see:</l>
<l>The hermit dress of skin he wore</l>
<l>Rent from his limbs distained with gore;</l>
<l>His senseless body lying slain,</l>
<l><q rend="post">His soul in Yama's dark domain.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alone the mourning pair I led,</l>
<l>Their souls with woe disquieted,</l>
<l>And let the dame and hermit lay</l>

<l>Their hands upon the breathless clay.</l>
<l>The father touched his son, and pressed</l>
<l>The body to his aged breast;</l>
<l>Then falling by the dead boy's side,</l>
<l>He lifted up his voice, and cried:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Hast thou no word, my child, to say?</q></l>
<l>No greeting for thy sire to-day?</l>
<l>Why art thou angry, darling? why</l>
<l>Wilt thou upon the cold earth lie?</l>
<l>If thou, my son, art wroth with me,</l>
<l>Here, duteous child, thy mother see.</l>
<l>What! no embrace for me, my son?</l>
<l>No word of tender love—not one?</l>
<l>Whose gentle voice, so soft and clear,</l>
<l>Soothing my spirit, shall I hear</l>
<l>When evening comes, with accents sweet</l>
<l>Scripture or ancient lore repeat?</l>
<l>Who, having fed the sacred fire,</l>
<l>And duly bathed, as texts require,</l>
<l>Will cheer, when evening rites are done,</l>
<l>The father mourning for his son?</l>
<l>Who will the daily meal provide</l>
<l>For the poor wretch who lacks a guide,</l>
<l>Feeding the helpless with the best</l>
<l>Berries and roots, like some dear guest?</l>
<l>How can these hands subsistence find</l>
<l>For thy poor mother, old and blind?</l>
<l>The wretched votaress how sustain,</l>
<l>Who mourns her child in ceaseless pain?</l>
<l>Stay yet a while, my darling, stay,</l>
<l>Nor fly to Yama's realm to-day.</l>
<l>To-morrow I thy sire and she</l>

<l>Seek the blest home prepared for all</l>

<l>Home of all virtuous spirits, earned</l>
<l>By fervent rites and Scripture learned:</l>
<l>By those whose sacred fires have glowed,</l>
<l>Whose liberal hands have fields bestowed:</l>
<l>By givers of a thousand cows,</l>
<l>By lovers of one faithful spouse:</l>
<l>By those who serve their masters well,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The father, with his consort's aid,</l>

<l>I mourn a slaughtered child, and thou</l>

<l>Bereft and suffering e'en as I,</l>
<l>So shalt thou mourn thy son, and die.</l>
<l>Thy hand unwitting dealt the blow</l>
<l>That laid a holy hermit low,</l>
<l>And distant, therefore, is the time</l>
<l>When thou shalt suffer for the crime.</l>
<l>The hour shall come when, crushed by woes</l>

<lg>

<l>Then on the pyre their bodies cast</l>

<l>The words that noble hermit said,</l>
<l>That I for a dear son should grieve,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And of the woe my life should leave.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the king with many a tear;</l>
<l>Then to his wife he cried in fear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I cannot see thee, love; but lay</q></l>
<l>Thy gentle hand in mine, I pray.</l>
<l>Ah me, if Ráma touched me thus,</l>
<l>If once, returning home to us,</l>
<l>He bade me wealth and lordship give,</l>
<l>Then, so I think, my soul would live.</l>
<l>Unlike myself, unjust and mean</l>
<l>Have been my ways with him, my Queen,</l>
<l>But like himself is all that he,</l>
<l>My noble son, has done to me.</l>
<l>His son, though far from right he stray,</l>
<l>What prudent sire would cast away?</l>
<l>What banished son would check his ire,</l>
<l>Nor speak reproaches of his sire?</l>
<l>I see thee not: these eyes grow blind,</l>
<l>And memory quits my troubled mind.</l>
<l>Angels of Death are round me: they</l>
<l>Summon my soul with speed away.</l>
<l>What woe more grievous can there be,</l>
<l>That, when from light and life I flee,</l>
<l>I may not, ere I part, behold</l>
<l>My virtuous Ráma, true and bold?</l>
<l>Grief for my son, the brave and true,</l>
<l>Whose joy it was my will to do,</l>
<l>Dries up my breath, as summer dries</l>
<l>The last drop in the pool that lies.</l>
<l>Not men, but blessed Gods, are they</l>
<l>Whose eyes shall see his face that day;</l>
<l>See him, when fourteen years are past,</l>
<l>With earrings decked return at last.</l>
<l>My fainting mind forgets to think:</l>
<l>Low and more low my spirits sink.</l>
<l>Each from its seat, my senses steal:</l>
<l>I cannot hear, or taste, or feel.</l>
<l>This lethargy of soul o'ercomes</l>
<l>Each organ, and its function numbs:</l>
<l>So when the oil begins to fail,</l>
<l>The torch's rays grow faint and pale.</l>
<l>This flood of woe caused by this hand</l>
<l>Destroys me helpless and unmanned,</l>
<l>Resistless as the floods that bore</l>
<l>A passage through the river shore.</l>
<l>Ah Raghu's son, ah mighty-armed,</l>
<l>By whom my cares were soothed and charmed,</l>

<head>Canto LXV. The Women's Lament.</head>

<lg>
<l>And now the night had past away,</l>
<l>And brightly dawned another day;</l>
<l>The minstrels, trained to play and sing,</l>
<l>Flocked to the chamber of the king:</l>
<l>Bards, who their gayest raiment wore,</l>
<l>And heralds famed for ancient lore:</l>
<l>And singers, with their songs of praise,</l>
<l>Made music in their several ways.</l>
<l>There as they poured their blessings choice</l>
<l>And hailed their king with hand and voice,</l>
<l>Their praises with a swelling roar</l>
<l>Echoed through court and corridor.</l>
<l>Then as the bards his glory sang,</l>
<l>From beaten palms loud answer rang,</l>
<l>As glad applauders clapped their hands,</l>
<l>And told his deeds in distant lands.</l>
<l>The swelling concert woke a throng</l>
<l>Of sleeping birds to life and song:</l>
<l>Some in the branches of the trees,</l>
<l>Some caged in halls and galleries.</l>
<l>Nor was the soft string music mute;</l>
<l>The gentle whisper of the lute,</l>
<l>And blessings sung by singers skilled</l>
<l>The palace of the monarch filled.</l>
<l>Eunuchs and dames of life unstained,</l>
<l>Each in the arts of waiting trained,</l>
<l>Drew near attentive as before,</l>
<l>And crowded to the chamber door:</l>
<l>These skilful when and how to shed</l>
<l>The lustral stream o'er limb and head,</l>
<l>Others with golden ewers stood</l>
<l>Of water stained with sandal wood.</l>
<l>And many a maid, pure, young, and fair,</l>
<l>Her load of early offerings bare,</l>
<l>Cups of the flood which all revere,</l>
<l>And sacred things, and toilet gear.</l>
<l>Each several thing was duly brought</l>
<l>As rule of old observance taught,</l>
<l>And lucky signs on each impressed</l>
<l>Stamped it the fairest and the best.</l>
<l>There anxious, in their long array,</l>
<l>All waited till the shine of day:</l>
<l>But when the king nor rose nor spoke,</l>
<l>Doubt and alarm within them woke.</l>
<l>Forthwith the dames, by duty led,</l>
<l>Attendants on the monarch's bed,</l>
<l>Within the royal chamber pressed</l>
<l>To wake their master from his rest.</l>
<l>Skilled in the lore of dreaming, they</l>
<l>First touched the bed on which he lay.</l>
<l>But none replied; no sound was heard,</l>
<pb n="173"/><anchor id="Pg173"/>
<l>Nor hand, nor head, nor body stirred.</l>
<l>They trembled, and their dread increased,</l>
<l>Fearing his breath of life had ceased,</l>
<l>And bending low their heads, they shook</l>
<l>Like the tall reeds that fringe the brook.</l>
<l>In doubt and terror down they knelt,</l>
<l>Looked on his face, his cold hand felt,</l>
<l>And then the gloomy truth appeared</l>
<l>Of all their hearts had darkly feared.</l>
<l>Kauśalyá and Sumitrá, worn</l>
<l>With weeping for their sons, forlorn,</l>
<l>Woke not, but lay in slumber deep</l>
<l>And still as death's unending sleep.</l>
<l>Bowed down by grief, her colour fled,</l>
<l>Her wonted lustre dull and dead,</l>
<l>Kauśalyá shone not, like a star</l>
<l>Obscured behind a cloudy bar.</l>
<l>Beside the king's her couch was spread,</l>
<l>And next was Queen Sumitrá's bed,</l>
<l>Who shone no more with beauty's glow,</l>
<l>Her face bedewed with tears of woe.</l>
<l>There lapped in sleep each wearied queen,</l>
<l>There as in sleep, the king was seen;</l>
<l>And swift the troubling thought came o'er</l>
<l>Their spirits that he breathed no more.</l>
<l>At once with wailing loud and high</l>
<l>The matrons shrieked a bitter cry,</l>
<l>As widowed elephants bewail</l>
<l>Their dead lord in the woody vale.</l>
<l>At the loud shriek that round them rang,</l>
<l>Kauśalyá and Sumitrá sprang</l>
<l>Awakened from their beds, with eyes</l>
<l>Wide open in their first surprise.</l>
<l>Quick to the monarch's side they came,</l>
<l>And saw and touched his lifeless frame;</l>
<l>One cry, O husband! forth they sent,</l>
<l>And prostrate to the ground they went.</l>
<l>The king of Kośal's daughter<note place="foot">Kauśalyá, daughter of the king of
another Kośal.</note> there</l>
<l>Writhed, with the dust on limb and hair</l>
<l>Lustreless, as a star might lie</l>
<l>Hurled downward from the glorious sky.</l>
<l>When the king's voice in death was stilled,</l>
<l>The women who the chamber filled</l>
<l>Saw, like a widow elephant slain,</l>
<l>Kauśalyá prostrate in her pain.</l>
<l>Then all the monarch's ladies led</l>
<l>By Queen Kaikeyí at their head,</l>
<l>Poured forth their tears, and weeping so,</l>
<l>Sank on the ground, consumed by woe.</l>
<l>The cry of grief so long and loud</l>
<l>Went up from all the royal crowd,</l>
<l>That, doubled by the matron train,</l>
<l>It made the palace ring again.</l>
<l>Filled with dark fear and eager eyes,</l>
<l>Anxiety and wild surmise;</l>
<l>Echoing with the cries of grief</l>
<l>Of sorrowing friends who mourned their chief,</l>
<l>Dejected, pale with deep distress,</l>
<l>Hurled from their height of happiness:</l>
<l>Such was the look the palace wore</l>
<l>Where lay the king who breathed no more.</l>

<l>That night of sorrow passed away,</l>

<l>With lesser lords these Bráhmans each</l>

<l>Of household priests him thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The night of bitter woe has past,</q></l>
<l>Which seemed a hundred years to last,</l>
<l>Our king, in sorrow for his son,</l>
<l>Reunion with the Five has won.</l>
<l>His soul is where the blessed are,</l>
<l>While Ráma roams in woods afar,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ, bright in glorious deeds,</l>
<l>Goes where his well-loved brother leads.</l>
<l>And Bharat and Śatrughna, they</l>
<l>Who smite their foes in battle fray,</l>

<l>Keeps Rájagriha's city fair.</l>
<l>Let one of old Ikshváku's race</l>
<l>Obtain this day the sovereign's place,</l>
<l>Or havoc and destruction straight</l>
<l>Our kingless land will devastate.</l>
<l>In kingless lands no thunder's voice,</l>
<l>No lightning wreaths the heart rejoice,</l>
<l>Nor does Parjanya's heavenly rain</l>
<l>Descend upon the burning plain.</l>
<l>Where none is king, the sower's hand</l>
<l>Casts not the seed upon the land;</l>
<l>The son against the father strives.</l>
<l>And husbands fail to rule their wives.</l>
<l>In kingless realms no princes call</l>
<l>Their friends to meet in crowded hall;</l>
<l>No joyful citizens resort</l>
<l>To garden trim or sacred court.</l>
<l>In kingless realms no Twice-born care</l>
<l>To sacrifice with text and prayer,</l>
<l>Nor Bráhmans, who their vows maintain,</l>
<l>The great solemnities ordain.</l>
<l>The joys of happier days have ceased:</l>
<l>No gathering, festival, or feast</l>
<l>Together calls the merry throng</l>
<l>Delighted with the play and song.</l>
<l>In kingless lands it ne'er is well</l>

<l>We hear no more the glad applause</l>
<l>When his strong bow each rival draws,</l>
<l>No clap of hands, no eager cries</l>
<l>That cheer each martial exercise.</l>

<l>And fear no danger on the road.</l>
<l>No sage secure in self-control,</l>

<l>Where'er at eve his feet may roam.</l>
<l>In kingless realms no man is sure</l>
<l>He holds his life and wealth secure.</l>
<l>In kingless lands no warriors smite</l>
<l>The foeman's host in glorious fight.</l>
<l>In kingless lands the wise no more,</l>
<l>Well trained in Scripture's holy lore,</l>
<l>In shady groves and gardens meet</l>
<l>To argue in their calm retreat.</l>
<l>No longer, in religious fear,</l>
<l>Do they who pious vows revere,</l>
<l>Bring dainty cates and wreaths of flowers</l>
<l>As offerings to the heavenly powers.</l>
<l>No longer, bright as trees in spring,</l>
<l>Shine forth the children of the king</l>
<l>Resplendent in the people's eyes</l>
<l>With aloe wood and sandal dyes.</l>
<l>A brook where water once has been,</l>
<l>A grove where grass no more is green,</l>
<l>Kine with no herdsman's guiding hand—</l>
<l>So wretched is a kingless land.</l>
<l>The car its waving banner rears,</l>
<l>Banner of fire the smoke appears:</l>
<l>Our king, the banner of our pride,</l>
<l>A God with Gods is glorified.</l>
<l>In kingless lands no law is known,</l>
<l>And none may call his wealth his own,</l>
<l>Each preys on each from hour to hour,</l>
<l>As fish the weaker fish devour.</l>
<l>Then fearless, atheists overleap</l>
<l>The bounds of right the godly keep,</l>
<l>And when no royal powers restrain,</l>
<l>Preëminence and lordship gain.</l>
<l>As in the frame of man the eye</l>

<l>He is the right, the truth is he,</l>
<l>Their hopes in him the well-born see.</l>
<l>On him his people's lives depend,</l>

Professor Wilson observes (<hi rend='italic'>Vishṇu Puráṇa</hi>,
p. 139. Dr. Hall's Edition) <q>States, and tribes, and cities have disappeared, even
from recollection; and some of the natural features of the country, especially the
rivers, have undergone a total alteration.… Notwithstanding these impediments, however,
we should be able to identify at least mountains and rivers, to a much greater
extent than is now practicable, if our maps were not so miserably defective in
their nomenclature. None of our surveyors or geographers have been oriental
scholars. It may be doubted if any of them have been conversant with the spoken
language of the country. They have, consequently, put down names at random, according
to their own inaccurate appreciation of sounds carelessly, vulgarly, and
corruptly uttered; and their maps of India are crowded with appellations which
bear no similitude whatever either to past or present denominations. We need not
wonder that we cannot discover Sanskrit names in English maps, when, in the immediate
vicinity of Calcutta, Barnagore represents Baráhanagar, Dakshineśwar is
metamorphosed into Duckinsore, Ulubaría into Willoughbury.… There
is scarcely a name in our Indian maps that does not afford proof of extreme indifference
to accuracy in nomenclature, and of an incorrectness in estimating
sounds, which is, in some degree, perhaps, a national defect.</q></p>

<head>Canto LXIX. Bharat's Dream.</head>

<lg>
<l>The night those messengers of state</l>
<l>Had past within the city's gate,</l>
<l>In dreams the slumbering Bharat saw</l>
<l>A sight that chilled his soul with awe.</l>
<l>The dream that dire events foretold</l>
<l>Left Bharat's heart with horror cold,</l>
<pb n="177"/><anchor id="Pg177"/>
<l>And with consuming woes distraught,</l>
<l>Upon his aged sire he thought.</l>
<l>His dear companions, swift to trace</l>
<l>The signs of anguish on his face,</l>
<l>Drew near, his sorrow to expel,</l>
<l>And pleasant tales began to tell.</l>
<l>Some woke sweet music's cheering sound,</l>
<l>And others danced in lively round.</l>
<l>With joke and jest they strove to raise</l>
<l>His spirits, quoting ancient plays;</l>
<l>But Bharat still, the lofty-souled,</l>
<l>Deaf to sweet tales his fellows told,</l>
<l>Unmoved by music, dance, and jest,</l>
<l>Sat silent, by his woe oppressed.</l>
<l>To him, begirt by comrades near,</l>
<l>Thus spoke the friend he held most dear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Why ringed around by friends, art thou</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">So silent and so mournful now?</q></l>
<l><q>Hear thou,</q> thus Bharat made reply,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What chills my heart and dims mine eye.</q></l>
<l>I dreamt I saw the king my sire</l>
<l>Sink headlong in a lake of mire</l>
<l>Down from a mountain high in air,</l>
<l>His body soiled, and loose his hair.</l>
<l>Upon the miry lake he seemed</l>
<l>To lie and welter, as I dreamed;</l>
<l>With hollowed hands full many a draught</l>
<l>Of oil he took, and loudly laughed.</l>
<l>With head cast down I saw him make</l>
<l>A meal on sesamum and cake;</l>
<l>The oil from every member dripped,</l>
<l>And in its clammy flood he dipped.</l>
<l>The ocean's bed was bare and dry,</l>
<l>The moon had fallen from the sky,</l>
<l>And all the world lay still and dead,</l>
<l>With whelming darkness overspread.</l>
<l>The earth was rent and opened wide,</l>
<l>The leafy trees were scorched, and died;</l>
<l>I saw the seated mountains split,</l>
<l>And wreaths of rising smoke emit.</l>
<l>The stately beast the monarch rode</l>
<l>His long tusks rent and splintered showed;</l>
<l>And flames that quenched and cold had lain</l>
<l>Blazed forth with kindled light again.</l>
<l>I looked, and many a handsome dame,</l>
<l>Arrayed in brown and sable came</l>
<l>And bore about the monarch, dressed,</l>
<l>On iron stool, in sable vest.</l>
<l>And then the king, of virtuous mind,</l>
<l>A blood-red wreath around him twined,</l>
<l>Forth on an ass-drawn chariot sped,</l>
<l>As southward still he bent his head.</l>
<l>Then, crimson-clad, a dame appeared</l>
<l>Who at the monarch laughed and jeered;</l>
<l>And a she-monster, dire to view,</l>
<l>Her hand upon his body threw.</l>
<l>Such is the dream I dreamt by night,</l>
<l>Which chills me yet with wild affright:</l>
<l>Either the king or Ráma, I</l>
<l>Or Lakshmaṇ now must surely die.</l>
<l>For when an ass-drawn chariot seems</l>
<l>To bear away a man in dreams,</l>
<l>Be sure above his funeral pyre</l>
<l>The smoke soon rears its cloudy spire.</l>
<l>This makes my spirit low and weak,</l>
<l>My tongue is slow and loth to speak:</l>
<l>My lips and throat are dry for dread,</l>
<l>And all my soul disquieted.</l>
<l>My lips, relaxed, can hardly speak,</l>
<l>And chilling dread has changed my cheek</l>
<l>I blame myself in aimless fears,</l>
<l>And still no cause of blame appears.</l>
<l>I dwell upon this dream of ill</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Whose changing scenes I viewed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on the startling horror still</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">My troubled thoughts will brood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still to my soul these terrors cling,</l>

<l>That passed, the sun began to rise,</l>

<l>Where men and women loved to meet,</l>
<l>In pleasant shades, for pastime sweet,—</l>
<l>These to my eyes this day appear</l>
<l>Joyless, and desolate, and drear:</l>
<l>Each tree that graced the garden grieves,</l>
<l>And every path is spread with leaves.</l>
<l>The merry cry of bird and beast,</l>
<l>That spake aloud their joy, has ceased:</l>
<l>Still is the long melodious note</l>
<l>That charmed us from each warbling throat.</l>
<l>Why blows the blessed air no more,</l>

<l>He entered in, he looked around,</l>
<l>Nor in the house his father found;</l>
<l>Then to his mother's dwelling, bent</l>
<l>To see her face, he quickly went.</l>
<l>She saw her son, so long away,</l>
<l>Returning after many a day,</l>
<l>And from her golden seat in joy</l>
<l>Sprung forward to her darling boy.</l>
<l>Within the bower, no longer bright,</l>

<l>Long kisses on his brow she pressed,</l>

<l>To meet my sire I sought this spot:</l>
<l>How is it that I find him not?</l>

<l>Tossing his arms, and a sad cry,</l>

<l>Where is that hand whose gentle touch,</l>

<l>The hand that loved to brush away</l>
<l>The dust that on his darling lay?</l>
<l>Quick, bear the news to Ráma's ear;</l>
<l>Tell the great chief that I am here:</l>
<l>Brother, and sire, and friend, and all</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus closely questioned by the youth,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He heard, yet deeper in despair,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Bharat's soul with fear was stirred</l>
<l>Lest Ráma from the right had erred,</l>
<l>And jealous for ancestral fame,</l>
<l>He put this question to the dame:</l>

<l>A Bráhman's house, or land, or gold?</l>
<l>Has Ráma harmed with ill intent</l>

<l><q rend="post">Like one who kills an unborn child?</q></l>

<l>But when I heard the monarch planned</l>
<l>To give the realm to Ráma's hand,</l>
<l>I prayed that Ráma hence might flee,</l>
<l>And claimed the throne, my son, for thee.</l>
<l>The king maintained the name he bare,</l>

<l>And hast thou from the kingdom chased</l>
<l>Her son, with bark around his waist,</l>
<l>To the wild wood, to dwell therein,</l>
<l>And dost not sorrow for thy sin?</l>
<l>The love I bare to Raghu's son</l>
<l>Thou knewest not, ambitious one,</l>
<l>If thou hast wrought this impious deed</l>
<l>For royal sway, in lawless greed.</l>
<l>With him and Lakshmaṇ far away,</l>
<l>What power have I the realm to sway?</l>
<l>What hope will fire my bosom when</l>
<l>I see no more these lords of men?</l>
<l>The holy king, who loved the right</l>
<l>Relied on Ráma's power and might,</l>
<l>His guardian and his glory, so</l>
<l>Joys Meru in his woods below.</l>
<l>How can I bear, a steer untrained,</l>
<l>The load his mightier strength sustained?</l>
<l>What power have I to brook alone</l>
<l>This weight on feeble shoulders thrown?</l>
<l>But if the needful power were bought</l>
<l>By strength of mind and brooding thought,</l>
<l>No triumph shall attend the dame</l>
<l>Who dooms her son to lasting shame.</l>
<l>Now should no doubt that son prevent</l>
<l>From quitting thee on evil bent.</l>
<l>But Ráma's love o'erpowers my will,</l>
<l>Who holds thee as his mother still.</l>
<l>Whence did the thought, O thou whose eyes</l>
<l>Are turned to sinful deeds, arise—</l>
<l>A plan our ancient sires would hate,</l>
<l>O fallen from thy virtuous state?</l>
<l>For in the line from which we spring</l>
<l>The eldest is anointed king:</l>
<l>No monarchs from the rule decline,</l>
<l>And, least of all, Ikshváku's line.</l>
<l>Our holy sires, to virtue true,</l>
<l>Upon our race a lustre threw,</l>
<l>But with subversive frenzy thou</l>
<l>Hast marred our lineal honour now,</l>
<l>Of lofty birth, a noble line</l>
<l>Of previous kings is also thine:</l>
<l>Then whence this hated folly? whence</l>
<l>This sudden change that steals thy sense?</l>
<l>Thou shalt not gain thine impious will,</l>
<l>O thou whose thoughts are bent on ill,</l>
<l>Thou from whose guilty hand descend</l>
<l>These sinful blows my life to end.</l>
<l>Now to the forest will I go,</l>
<l>Thy cherished plans to overthrow,</l>
<l>And bring my brother, free from stain,</l>
<l>His people's darling, home again.</l>
<l>And Ráma, when again he turns,</l>
<l>Whose glory like a beacon burns,</l>

<l>When Bharat's anger-sharpened tongue</l>
<l>Reproaches on the queen had flung,</l>
<l>Again, with mighty rage possessed,</l>
<l>The guilty dame he thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Flee, cruel, wicked sinner, flee,</q></l>
<l>Let not this kingdom harbour thee.</l>
<l>Thou who hast thrown all right aside,</l>
<l>Weep thou for me when I have died.</l>
<l>Canst thou one charge against the king,</l>
<l>Or the most duteous Ráma bring?</l>
<l>The one thy sin to death has sent,</l>
<l>The other chased to banishment.</l>
<l>Our line's destroyer, sin defiled</l>
<l>Like one who kills an unborn child,</l>
<l>Ne'er with thy lord in heaven to dwell,</l>
<l>Thy portion shall be down in hell</l>
<l>Because thy hand, that stayed for naught,</l>
<l>This awful wickedness has wrought,</l>
<l>And ruined him whom all held dear,</l>
<l>My bosom too is stirred with fear.</l>
<l>My father by thy sin is dead,</l>
<l>And Ráma to the wood is fled;</l>
<l>And of thy deed I bear the stain,</l>
<l>And fameless in the world remain.</l>
<l>Ambitious, evil-souled, in show</l>
<l>My mother, yet my direst foe.</l>
<l>My throning ne'er thine eyes shall bless,</l>
<l>Thy husband's wicked murderess.</l>
<pb n="183"/><anchor id="Pg183"/>
<l>Thou art not Aśvapati's child,</l>
<l>That righteous king most sage and mild,</l>
<l>But thou wast born a fiend, a foe</l>
<l>My father's house to overthrow.</l>
<l>Thou who hast made Kauśalyá, pure,</l>
<l>Gentle, affectionate, endure</l>
<l>The loss of him who was her bliss,—</l>
<l>What worlds await thee, Queen, for this?</l>
<l>Was it not patent to thy sense</l>
<l>That Ráma was his friends' defence,</l>
<l>Kauśalyá's own true child most dear,</l>
<l>The eldest and his father's peer?</l>
<l>Men in the son not only trace</l>
<l>The father's figure, form, and face,</l>
<l>But in his heart they also find</l>
<l>The offspring of the father's mind;</l>
<l>And hence, though dear their kinsmen are,</l>
<l>To mothers sons are dearer far.</l>
<l>There goes an ancient legend how</l>
<l>Good Surabhí, the God-loved cow,</l>
<l>Saw two of her dear children strain,</l>
<l>Drawing a plough and faint with pain.</l>
<l>She saw them on the earth outworn,</l>
<l>Toiling till noon from early morn,</l>
<l>And as she viewed her children's woe,</l>
<l>A flood of tears began to flow.</l>
<l>As through the air beneath her swept</l>
<l>The Lord of Gods, the drops she wept,</l>
<l>Fine, laden with delicious smell,</l>
<l>Upon his heavenly body fell.</l>
<l>And Indra lifted up his eyes</l>
<l>And saw her standing in the skies,</l>
<l>Afflicted with her sorrow's weight,</l>
<l>Sad, weeping, all disconsolate.</l>
<l>The Lord of Gods in anxious mood</l>
<l>Thus spoke in suppliant attitude:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">No fear disturbs our rest, and how</q></l>
<l>Come this great dread upon thee now?</l>
<l>Whence can this woe upon thee fall,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Say, gentle one who lovest all?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the God who rules the skies,</l>
<l>Indra, the Lord supremely wise;</l>
<l>And gentle Surabhí, well learned</l>
<l>In eloquence, this speech returned:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Not thine the fault, great God, not thine</q></l>
<l>And guiltless are the Lords divine:</l>
<l>I mourn two children faint with toil,</l>
<l>Labouring hard in stubborn soil.</l>
<l>Wasted and sad I see them now,</l>
<l>While the sun beats on neck and brow,</l>
<l>Still goaded by the cruel hind,—</l>
<l>No pity in his savage mind.</l>
<l>O Indra, from this body sprang</l>
<l>These children, worn with many a pang.</l>
<l>For this sad sight I mourn, for none</l>
<l><q rend="post">Is to the mother like her son.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He saw her weep whose offspring feed</l>
<l>In thousands over hill and mead,</l>
<l>And knew that in a mother's eye</l>
<l>Naught with a son, for love, can vie.</l>
<l>He deemed her, when the tears that came</l>
<l>From her sad eyes bedewed his frame,</l>
<l>Laden with their celestial scent,</l>
<l>Of living things most excellent.</l>
<l>If she these tears of sorrow shed</l>
<l>Who many a thousand children bred,</l>
<l>Think what a life of woe is left</l>
<l>Kauśalyá, of her Ráma reft.</l>
<l>An only son was hers and she</l>
<l>Is rendered childless now by thee.</l>
<l>Here and hereafter, for thy crime,</l>
<l>Woe is thy lot through endless time.</l>
<l>And now, O Queen, without delay,</l>
<l>With all due honour will I pay</l>
<l>Both to my brother and my sire</l>
<l>The rites their several fates require.</l>
<l>Back to Ayodhyá will I bring</l>
<l>The long-armed chief, her lord and king,</l>
<l>And to the wood myself betake</l>
<l>Where hermit saints their dwelling make.</l>
<l>For, sinner both in deed and thought!</l>
<l>This hideous crime which thou hast wrought</l>
<l>I cannot bear, or live to see</l>
<l>The people's sad eyes bent on me.</l>
<l>Begone, to Daṇḍak wood retire,</l>
<l>Or cast thy body to the fire,</l>
<l>Or bind around thy neck the rope:</l>
<l>No other refuge mayst thou hope.</l>
<l>When Ráma, lord of valour true,</l>
<l>Has gained the earth, his right and due,</l>
<l>Then, free from duty's binding debt,</l>
<l><q rend="post">My vanished sin shall I forget.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus like an elephant forced to brook</l>

<l>A while he lay: he rose at length,</l>

<l>With angry eyes which tears bedewed,</l>
<l>The miserable queen he viewed,</l>

<l>Bharat, Śatrughna by his side,</l>

<l>And when the royal dame they viewed</l>
<l>Distressed with dire solicitude,</l>
<l>Sad, fallen senseless on the ground,</l>
<l>About her neck their arms they wound.</l>
<l>The noble matron prostrate there,</l>
<l>Embraced, with tears, the weeping pair,</l>
<l>And with her load of grief oppressed,</l>
<l>To Bharat then these words addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now all is thine, without a foe,</q></l>
<l>This realm for which thou longest so.</l>
<l>Ah, soon Kaikeyí's ruthless hand</l>
<l>Has won the empire of the land,</l>
<l>And made my guiltless Ráma flee</l>
<l>Dressed like some lonely devotee.</l>
<l>Herein what profit has the queen,</l>

<l>Me also, me 'twere surely good</l>
<l>To banish to the distant wood,</l>
<l>To dwell amid the shades that hold</l>
<l>My famous son with limbs like gold.</l>
<l>Nay, with the sacred fire to guide,</l>

<l>Again the hero wept and sighed</l>
<l>Distraught and sorrow-stupefied;</l>
<l>Drew, sobbing in his anguish, near,</l>
<l>The last remaining debt to clear,</l>
<l>And at the bottom of the pyre,</l>
<l>He thus bespake his royal sire:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O father, hast thou left me so,</q></l>
<l>Deserted in my friendless woe,</l>
<l>When he to whom the charge was given</l>
<l>To keep me, to the wood is driven?</l>
<l>Her only son is forced away</l>
<l>Who was his helpless mother's stay:</l>
<l>Ah, whither, father, art thou fled;</l>
<l><q rend="post">Leaving the queen uncomforted?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He looked upon the pile where lay</l>
<l>The bones half-burnt and ashes grey,</l>
<l>And uttering a piteous moan,</l>
<l>Gave way, by anguish overthrown.</l>
<l>Then as his tears began to well,</l>
<l>Prostrate to earth the hero fell;</l>
<l>So from its seat the staff they drag,</l>
<l>And cast to earth some glorious flag.</l>
<l>The ministers approached again</l>
<l>The prince whom rites had freed from stain;</l>
<l>So when Yayáti fell, each seer,</l>
<l>In pity for his fate, drew near.</l>
<l>Śatrughna saw him lying low</l>
<l>O'erwhelmed beneath the crush of woe,</l>
<l>And as upon the king he thought,</l>
<l>He fell upon the earth distraught.</l>
<l>When to his loving memory came</l>
<l>Those noble gifts, that kingly frame,</l>
<l>He sorrowed, by his woe distressed,</l>
<l>As one by frenzied rage possessed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah me, this surging sea of woe</q></l>
<l>Has drowned us with its overflow:</l>
<l>The source is Manthará, dire and dark,</l>
<l>Kaikeyí is the ravening shark:</l>
<l>And the great boons the monarch gave</l>
<l>Lend conquering might to every wave.</l>
<l>Ah, whither wilt thou go, and leave</l>
<l>Thy Bharat in his woe to grieve,</l>
<l>Whom ever 'twas thy greatest joy</l>
<l>To fondle as a tender boy?</l>
<l>Didst thou not give with thoughtful care</l>
<l>Our food, our drink, our robes to wear?</l>
<l>Whose love will now for us provide,</l>
<l>When thou, our king and sire, hast died?</l>
<l>At such a time bereft, forlorn,</l>
<l>Why is not earth in sunder torn,</l>
<l>Missing her monarch's firm control,</l>
<l>His love of right, his lofty soul?</l>
<l>Ah me, for Ráma roams afar,</l>
<l>My sire is where the Blessed are;</l>
<l>How can I live deserted? I</l>
<l>Will pass into the fire and die.</l>
<l>Abandoned thus, I will not brook</l>
<l>Upon Ayodhyá's town to look,</l>
<l>Once guarded by Ikshváku's race:</l>
<l><q rend="post">The wood shall be my dwelling place.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then when the princes' mournful train</l>
<l>Heard the sad brothers thus complain,</l>
<l>And saw their misery, at the view</l>
<l>Their grief burst wilder out anew.</l>
<l>Faint with lamenting, sad and worn,</l>
<l>Each like a bull with broken horn,</l>
<l>The brothers in their wild despair</l>
<l>Lay rolling, mad with misery, there.</l>
<l>Then old Vaśishṭha good and true,</l>
<l>Their father's priest, all lore who knew,</l>
<l>Raised weeping Bharat on his feet,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sumantra bade Śatrughna rise,</l>

<l>How all things are and come to naught.</l>
<l>When rose each hero from the ground,</l>

<l>Śatrughna thus to Bharat spake</l>
<l>Who longed the forest road to take:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">He who in woe was wont to give</q></l>
<l>Strength to himself and all that live—</l>
<l>Dear Ráma, true and pure in heart,</l>
<l>Is banished by a woman's art.</l>
<l>Yet here was Lakshmaṇ, brave and strong,</l>
<l>Could not his might prevent the wrong?</l>
<l>Could not his arm the king restrain,</l>
<l>Or make the banished free again?</l>
<l>One loving right and fearing crime</l>

<l><q rend="post">His feet approached the path of ill.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Lakshmaṇ's younger brother, dread</l>
<l>Śatrughna, thus to Bharat said,</l>
<l>Came to the fronting door, arrayed</l>
<l>In glittering robes, the hump-back maid.</l>
<l>There she, with sandal-oil besmeared,</l>
<l>In garments meet for queens appeared:</l>
<l>And lustre to her form was lent</l>
<l>By many a gem and ornament.</l>
<l>She girdled with her broidered zone,</l>
<l>And many a chain about her thrown,</l>
<l>Showed like a female monkey round</l>
<l>Whose body many a string is bound.</l>
<l>When on that cause of evil fell</l>
<l>The quick eye of the sentinel,</l>
<l>He grasped her in his ruthless hold,</l>
<l>And hastening in, Śatrughna told:</l>
<l><q>Here is the wicked pest,</q> he cried,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Through whom the king thy father died,</q></l>
<l>And Ráma wanders in the wood:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Do with her as thou deemest good.</q></l>
<l>The warder spoke: and every word</l>
<l>Śatrughna's breast to fury stirred:</l>
<l>He called the servants, all and each.</l>
<l>And spake in wrath his hasty speech:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This is the wretch my sire who slew,</q></l>
<l>And misery on my brothers drew:</l>
<l>Let her this day obtain the meed,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Vile sinner, of her cruel deed.</q></l>
<l>He spake; and moved by fury laid</l>
<l>His mighty hand upon the maid,</l>
<l>Who as her fellows ringed her round,</l>
<l>Made with her cries the hall resound.</l>
<l>Soon as the gathered women viewed</l>
<l>Śatrughna in his angry mood,</l>
<l>Their hearts disturbed by sudden dread,</l>
<l>They turned and from his presence fled.</l>
<l><q>His rage,</q> they cried, <q rend="pre">on us will fall,</q></l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His eyes with burning wrath aglow,</l>
<l>Śatrughna, shatterer of the foe,</l>
<l>Dragged on the ground the hump-back maid</l>
<l>Who shrieked aloud and screamed for aid.</l>
<l>This way and that with no remorse</l>
<l>He dragged her with resistless force,</l>
<l>And chains and glittering trinkets burst</l>
<l>Lay here and there with gems dispersed,</l>
<l>Till like the sky of Autumn shone</l>
<l>The palace floor they sparkled on.</l>
<l>The lord of men, supremely strong,</l>
<l>Haled in his rage the wretch along:</l>
<l>Where Queen Kaikeyí dwelt he came,</l>
<l>And sternly then addressed the dame.</l>
<l>Deep in her heart Kaikeyí felt</l>
<l>The stabs his keen reproaches dealt,</l>
<l>And of Śatrughna's ire afraid,</l>
<l>To Bharat flew and cried for aid.</l>
<l>He looked and saw the prince inflamed</l>
<l>With burning rage, and thus exclaimed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Forgive! thine angry arm restrain:</q></l>
<l>A woman never may be slain.</l>
<l>My hand Kaikeyí's blood would spill,</l>
<l>The sinner ever bent on ill,</l>

<l>Would hate the impious matricide:</l>

<l>Now when the sun's returning ray</l>
<l>Had ushered in the fourteenth day,</l>
<l>The gathered peers of state addressed</l>
<l>To Bharat's ear their new request:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Our lord to heaven has parted hence,</q></l>
<l>Long served with deepest reverence;</l>
<l>Ráma, the eldest, far from home,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ, in the forest roam.</l>
<l>O Prince, of mighty fame, be thou</l>
<l>Our guardian and our monarch now,</l>
<l>Lest secret plot or foeman's hate</l>
<l>Assail our unprotected state.</l>
<l>With longing eyes, O Lord of men,</l>
<l>To thee look friend and citizen,</l>
<l>And ready is each sacred thing</l>
<l>To consecrate our chosen king.</l>
<l>Come, Bharat, and accept thine own</l>
<l>Ancient hereditary throne.</l>
<l>Thee let the priests this day install</l>
<l><q rend="post">As monarch to preserve us all.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around the sacred gear he bent</l>
<l>His circling footsteps reverent,</l>
<l>And, firm to vows he would not break,</l>
<l>Thus to the gathered people spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The eldest son is ever king:</q></l>
<l>So rules the house from which we spring:</l>
<l>Nor should ye, Lords, like men unwise,</l>
<l>With words like these to wrong advise.</l>
<l>Ráma is eldest born, and he</l>
<l>The ruler of the land shall be.</l>
<l>Now to the woods will I repair,</l>
<l>Five years and nine to lodge me there.</l>
<l>Assemble straight a mighty force,</l>
<l>Cars, elephants, and foot and horse,</l>
<l>For I will follow on his track</l>
<l>And bring my eldest brother back.</l>
<l>Whate'er the rites of throning need</l>
<l>Placed on a car the way shall lead:</l>
<l>The sacred vessels I will take</l>
<l>To the wild wood for Ráma's sake.</l>
<l>I o'er the lion prince's head</l>
<l>The sanctifying balm will shed,</l>
<l>And bring him, as the fire they bring</l>
<l>Forth from the shrine, with triumphing.</l>
<l>Nor will I let my mother's greed</l>
<l>In this her cherished aim succeed:</l>
<l>In pathless wilds will I remain,</l>

<l>Send workman out and pioneer:</l>

<l><q rend="post">Our way through pathless spots to guide.</q></l>
<l>As thus the royal Bharat spake,</l>

<l>Can one of Daśaratha's seed</l>
<l>Be guilty of so vile a deed?</l>
<l>The realm and I are Ráma's: thou,</l>
<l>Shouldst speak the words of justice now.</l>
<l>For he, to claims of virtue true,</l>
<l>Is eldest born and noblest too:</l>
<l>Nahush, Dilípa could not be</l>
<l>More famous in their lives than he.</l>
<l>As Daśaratha ruled of right,</l>
<l>So Ráma's is the power and right.</l>
<l>If I should do this sinful deed</l>
<l>And forfeit hope of heavenly meed,</l>
<l>My guilty act would dim the shine</l>
<l>Of old Ikshváku's glorious line.</l>
<l>Nay, as the sin my mother wrought</l>
<l>Is grievous to my inmost thought,</l>
<l>I here, my hands together laid,</l>
<l>Will greet him in the pathless shade.</l>
<l>To Ráma shall my steps be bent,</l>
<l>My King, of men most excellent,</l>
<l>Raghu's illustrious son, whose sway</l>
<l><q rend="post">Might hell, and earth, and heaven obey.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That righteous speech, whose every word</l>
<l>Bore virtue's stamp, the audience heard;</l>
<l>On Ráma every thought was set,</l>
<l>And with glad tears each eye was wet.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Then, if the power I still should lack</q></l>
<l>To bring my noble brother back,</l>
<l>I in the wood will dwell, and share</l>
<l>His banishment with Lakshmaṇ there.</l>
<l>By every art persuasive I</l>
<l>To bring him from the wood will try,</l>
<l>And show him to your loving eyes,</l>
<l>O Bráhmans noble, good, and wise.</l>
<l>E'en now, the road to make and clear,</l>
<l>Each labourer pressed, and pioneer</l>
<l>Have I sent forward to precede</l>
<l><q rend="post">The army I resolve to lead.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, by fraternal love possessed,</l>
<l>His firm resolve the prince expressed,</l>
<l>Then to Sumantra, deeply read</l>
<l>In holy texts, he turned and said:</l>

<l>And as I bid my words obey.</l>
<l>Give orders for the march with speed,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And all the army hither lead.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,</l>
<l>Obeyed the high-souled chief's behest.</l>
<l>He hurried forth with joy inspired</l>
<l>And gave the orders he desired.</l>
<l>Delight each soldier's bosom filled,</l>
<l>And through each chief and captain thrilled,</l>
<pb n="191"/><anchor id="Pg191"/>
<l>To hear that march proclaimed, to bring</l>
<l>Dear Ráma back from wandering.</l>
<l>From house to house the tidings flew:</l>
<l>Each soldier's wife the order knew,</l>
<l>And as she listened blithe and gay</l>
<l>Her husband urged to speed away.</l>
<l>Captain and soldier soon declared</l>
<l>The host equipped and all prepared</l>
<l>With chariots matching thought for speed,</l>
<l>And wagons drawn by ox and steed.</l>
<l>When Bharat by Vaśishṭha's side,</l>
<l>His ready host of warriors eyed,</l>
<l>Thus in Sumantra's ear he spoke:</l>
<l><q>My car and horses quickly yoke.</q></l>
<l>Sumantra hastened to fulfil</l>
<l>With ready joy his master's will,</l>
<l>And quickly with the chariot sped</l>
<l>Drawn by fleet horses nobly bred.</l>
<l>Then glorious Bharat, true, devout,</l>
<l>Whose genuine valour none could doubt,</l>
<l>Gave in fit words his order out;</l>
<l>For he would seek the shade</l>
<l>Of the great distant wood, and there</l>
<l>Win his dear brother with his prayer:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Sumantra, haste! my will declare</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The host be all arrayed.</l>
<l>I to the wood my way will take,</l>

<l>And for the world's advantage sake,</l>

<l>Then, ordered thus, the charioteer</l>
<l>Who listened with delighted ear,</l>
<l>Went forth and gave his orders clear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To captains of the train.</l>
<l>He gave the popular chiefs the word,</l>
<l>And with the news his friends he stirred,</l>

<l>Then Bráhman, Warrior, Merchant, thrall,</l>

<lg>
<l>Then Bharat rose at early morn,</l>
<l>And in his noble chariot borne</l>
<l>Drove forward at a rapid pace</l>
<l>Eager to look on Ráma's face.</l>
<l>The priests and lords, a fair array,</l>
<l>In sun-bright chariots led the way.</l>
<l>Behind, a well appointed throng,</l>
<l>Nine thousand elephants streamed along.</l>
<l>Then sixty thousand cars, and then,</l>
<l>With various arms, came fighting men.</l>
<l>A hundred thousand archers showed</l>
<l>In lengthened line the steeds they rode—</l>
<l>A mighty host, the march to grace</l>
<l>Of Bharat, pride of Raghu's race.</l>
<l>Kaikeyí and Sumitrá came,</l>
<l>And good Kauśalyá, dear to fame:</l>
<l>By hopes of Ráma's coming cheered</l>
<l>They in a radiant car appeared.</l>
<l>On fared the noble host to see</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ, wild with glee,</l>
<l>And still each other's ear to please,</l>
<l>Of Ráma spoke in words like these:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">When shall our happy eyes behold</q></l>
<l>Our hero true, and pure, and bold,</l>
<l>So lustrous dark, so strong of arm,</l>
<l>Who keeps the world from woe and harm?</l>
<l>The tears that now our eyeballs dim</l>
<l>Will vanish at the sight of him,</l>
<l>As the whole world's black shadows fly</l>
<l><q rend="post">When the bright sun ascends the sky.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Conversing thus their way pursued</l>
<l>The city's joyous multitude,</l>
<l>And each in mutual rapture pressed</l>
<l>A friend or neighbour to his breast.</l>
<l>Thus every man of high renown,</l>
<l>And every merchant of the town,</l>
<l>And leading subjects, joyous went</l>
<l>Toward Ráma in his banishment.</l>
<l>And those who worked the potter's wheel,</l>
<l>And artists skilled in gems to deal;</l>
<l>And masters of the weaver's art,</l>
<l>And those who shaped the sword and dart;</l>
<l>And they who golden trinkets made,</l>
<l>And those who plied the fuller's trade;</l>
<l>And servants trained the bath to heat,</l>
<l>And they who dealt in incense sweet;</l>
<l>Physicians in their business skilled,</l>

<l>Or lived by sale of precious scent;</l>
<l>And men who washed, and men who sewed,</l>
<l>And thralls who mid the herds abode;</l>
<l>And fishers of the flood, and they</l>
<l>Who played and sang, and women gay;</l>
<l>And virtuous Bráhmans, Scripture-wise,</l>
<l>Of life approved in all men's eyes;</l>
<l>These swelled the prince's lengthened train,</l>
<l>Borne each in car or bullock wain.</l>
<l>Fair were the robes they wore upon</l>
<l>Their limbs where red-hued unguents shone.</l>
<l>These all in various modes conveyed</l>
<l>Their journey after Bharat made;</l>
<l>The soldiers' hearts with rapture glowed,</l>
<l>Following Bharat on his road,</l>
<l>Their chief whose tender love would fain</l>
<l>Bring his dear brother home again.</l>
<l>With elephant, and horse, and car,</l>
<l>The vast procession travelled far,</l>
<pb n="192"/><anchor id="Pg192"/>
<l>And came where Gangá's waves below</l>
<l>The town of Śringavera<note place="foot">Now Sungroor, in the Allahabad
district.</note> flow.</l>
<l>There, with his friends and kinsmen nigh,</l>
<l>Dwelt Guha, Ráma's dear ally,</l>
<l>Heroic guardian of the land</l>
<l>With dauntless heart and ready hand.</l>
<l>There for a while the mighty force</l>
<l>That followed Bharat stayed its course,</l>
<l>Gazing on Gangá's bosom stirred</l>
<l>By many a graceful water-bird.</l>
<l>When Bharat viewed his followers there,</l>
<l>And Gangá's water, blest and fair,</l>
<l>The prince, who lore of words possessed,</l>
<l>His councillors and lords addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The captains of the army call:</q></l>
<l>Proclaim this day a halt for all,</l>
<l>That so to-morrow, rested, we</l>
<l>May cross this flood that seeks the sea.</l>
<l>Meanwhile, descending to the shore,</l>
<l>The funeral stream I fain would pour</l>
<l>From Gangá's fair auspicious tide</l>
<l><q rend="post">To him, my father glorified.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Bharat spoke: each peer and lord</l>
<l>Approved his words with one accord,</l>
<l>And bade the weary troops repose</l>
<l>In separate spots where'er they chose.</l>
<l>There by the mighty stream that day,</l>
<l>Most glorious in its vast array</l>
<l>The prince's wearied army lay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In various groups reclined.</l>
<l>There Bharat's hours of night were spent,</l>

<lg>
<l>King Guha saw the host spread o'er</l>
<l>The wide expanse of Gangá's shore,</l>
<l>With waving flag and pennon graced,</l>
<l>And to his followers spoke in haste:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">A mighty army meets my eyes,</q></l>
<l>That rivals Ocean's self in size:</l>
<l>Where'er I look my very mind</l>
<l>No limit to the host can find.</l>
<l>Sure Bharat with some evil thought</l>
<l>His army to our land has brought.</l>
<l>See, huge of form, his flag he rears,</l>
<l>That like an Ebony-tree appears.</l>
<l>He comes with bonds to take and chain,</l>
<l>Or triumph o'er our people slain:</l>
<l>And after, Ráma will he slay,—</l>
<l>Him whom his father drove away:</l>
<l>The power complete he longs to gain,</l>
<l>And—task too hard—usurp the reign.</l>
<l>So Bharat comes with wicked will</l>
<l>His brother Ráma's blood to spill.</l>
<l>But Ráma's slave and friend am I;</l>
<l>He is my lord and dear ally.</l>
<l>Keep here your watch in arms arrayed</l>
<l>Near Gangá's flood to lend him aid,</l>
<l>And let my gathered servants stand</l>
<l>And line with troops the river strand.</l>
<l>Here let the river keepers meet,</l>
<l>Who flesh and roots and berries eat;</l>
<l>A hundred fishers man each boat</l>
<l>Of the five hundred here afloat,</l>
<l>And let the youthful and the strong</l>
<l>Assemble in defensive throng.</l>
<l>But yet, if, free from guilty thought</l>
<l>'Gainst Ráma, he this land have sought,</l>
<l>The prince's happy host to-day</l>
<l><q rend="post">Across the flood shall make its way.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: then bearing in a dish</l>
<l>A gift of honey, meat, and fish,</l>
<l>The king of the Nishádas drew</l>
<l>Toward Bharat for an interview.</l>
<l>When Bharat's noble charioteer</l>
<l>Observed the monarch hastening near,</l>

<l>The tidings to his master bore:</l>

<l>Replied in seemly words that blent</l>
<l>Deep matter with the argument:</l>

<l>With honours high hast met me here,</l>
<l>For thou alone wouldst entertain</l>
<l><q rend="post">And feed to-day so vast a train.</q></l>
<l>In such fair words the prince replied,</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Which way aright will lead my feet</q></l>
<l>To Bharadvája's calm retreat;</l>
<l>For all this land near Gangá's streams</l>
<l><q rend="post">Pathless and hard to traverse seems?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the prince: King Guha heard</l>
<l>Delighted every prudent word,</l>
<l>And gazing on that forest wide,</l>
<l>Raised suppliant hands, and thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My servants, all the ground who know,</q></l>
<l>O glorious Prince, with thee shall go</l>
<l>With constant care thy way to guide,</l>
<l>And I will journey by thy side.</l>

<l><q rend="post">Ill thoughts thy journey stimulate.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when King Guha, ill at ease,</l>
<l>Declared his fear in words like these,</l>
<l>As pure as is the cloudless sky</l>
<l>With soft voice Bharat made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Suspect me not: ne'er come the time</q></l>
<l>For me to plot so foul a crime!</l>
<l>He is my eldest brother, he</l>
<l>Is like a father dear to me.</l>
<l>I go to lead my brother thence</l>
<l>Who makes the wood his residence.</l>
<l>No thought but this thy heart should frame:</l>
<l><q rend="post">This simple truth my lips proclaim.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with glad cheer King Guha cried,</l>
<l>With Bharat's answer gratified:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Blessed art thou: on earth I see</q></l>
<l>None who may vie, O Prince, with thee,</l>
<l>Who canst of thy free will resign</l>
<l>The kingdom which unsought is thine.</l>

<l>Soon as King Guha's thoughtful care</l>

<l>The tale of Lakshmaṇ mighty-souled:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">With many an earnest word I spake</q></l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ as he stayed awake,</l>
<l>And with his bow and shaft in hand</l>
<l>To guard his brother kept his stand:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now sleep a little, Lakshmaṇ, see</q></l>
<l>This pleasant bed is strewn for thee:</l>
<l>Hereon thy weary body lay,</l>
<l>And strengthen thee with rest, I pray,</l>
<l>Inured to toil are men like these,</l>
<l>But thou hast aye been nursed in ease.</l>
<l>Rest, duteous-minded! I will keep</l>
<l>My watch while Ráma lies asleep:</l>
<l>For in the whole wide world is none</l>
<l>Dearer to me than Raghu's son.</l>
<l>Harbour no doubt or jealous fear:</l>
<l>I speak the truth with heart sincere:</l>
<l>For from the grace which he has shown</l>
<l>Will glory on my name be thrown:</l>
<l>Great store of merit shall I gain,</l>
<l>And duteous, form no wish in vain.</l>
<l>Let me enforced by many a row</l>
<l>Of followers, armed with shaft and bow</l>
<l>For well-loved Ráma's weal provide</l>
<l>Who lies asleep by Sítá's side.</l>
<l>For through this wood I often go,</l>
<l>And all its shades conceal I know:</l>
<l>And we with conquering arms can meet</l>
<l><q rend="post">A four-fold host arrayed complete.</q></l>
<l><q rend="pre">With words like these I spoke, designed</q></l>
<l>To move the high-souled Bharat's mind,</l>
<l>But he upon his duty bent,</l>
<l>Plied his persuasive argument:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O, how can slumber close mine eyes</q></l>
<l>When lowly couched with Sítá lies</l>
<l>The royal Ráma? can I give</l>
<l>My heart to joy, or even live?</l>
<l>He whom no mighty demon, no,</l>
<l>Nor heavenly God can overthrow,</l>
<l>See, Guha, how he lies, alas,</l>
<pb n="194"/><anchor id="Pg194"/>
<l>With Sítá couched on gathered grass.</l>
<l>By varied labours, long, severe,</l>
<l>By many a prayer and rite austere,</l>
<l>He, Daśaratha's cherished son,</l>
<l>By Fortune stamped, from Heaven was won.</l>
<l>Now as his son is forced to fly,</l>
<l>The king ere long will surely die:</l>
<l>Reft of his guardian hand, forlorn</l>
<l>In widowed grief this land will mourn.</l>
<l>E'en now perhaps, with toil o'erspent,</l>
<l>The women cease their loud lament,</l>
<l>And cries of woe no longer ring</l>
<l>Throughout the palace of the king.</l>
<l>But ah for sad Kauśalyá! how</l>
<l>Fare she and mine own mother now?</l>
<l>How fares the king? this night, I think,</l>
<l>Some of the three in death will sink.</l>
<l>With hopes upon Śatrughna set</l>
<l>My mother may survive as yet,</l>
<l>But the sad queen will die who bore</l>
<l>The hero, for her grief is sore.</l>
<l>His cherished wish that would have made</l>
<l>Dear Ráma king, so long delayed,</l>
<l><q>Too late! too late!</q> the king will cry,</l>
<l>And conquered by his misery die.</l>
<l>When Fate has brought the mournful day</l>
<l>Which sees my father pass away,</l>
<l>How happy in their lives are they</l>
<l>Allowed his funeral rites to pay.</l>
<l>Our exile o'er, with him who ne'er</l>
<l>Turns from the oath his lips may swear,</l>
<l>May we returning safe and well</l>

<l>Thus Bharat stood with many a sigh</l>
<l>Lamenting, and the night went by.</l>
<l>Soon as the morning light shone fair</l>
<l>In votive coils both bound their hair.</l>
<l>And then I sent them safely o'er</l>
<l>And left them on the farther shore.</l>

<l>The mighty tamers of the foe,</l>

<l>Of their dear king, with fasting worn,</l>
<l>And stood with weeping eyes around</l>
<l>The hero prostrate on the ground.</l>
<l>Kauśalyá, by her woe oppressed,</l>
<l>The senseless Bharat's limbs caressed,</l>
<l>As a fond cow in love and fear</l>
<l>Caresses oft her youngling dear:</l>
<l>Then yielding to her woe she said,</l>
<l>Weeping and sore disquieted:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What torments, O my son, are these</q></l>
<l>Of sudden pain or swift disease?</l>
<l>The lives of us and all the line</l>
<l>Depend, dear child, on only thine.</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ forced to flee,</l>
<l>I live by naught but seeing thee:</l>
<l>For as the king has past away</l>
<l>Thou art my only help to-day.</l>
<l>Hast thou, perchance, heard evil news</l>
<l>Of Lakshmaṇ, which thy soul subdues,</l>
<l>Or Ráma dwelling with his spouse—</l>
<l><q rend="post">My all is he—neath forest boughs?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then slowly gathering sense and strength</l>
<l>The weeping hero rose at length,</l>
<l>And words like these to Guha spake,</l>
<l>That bade Kauśalyá comfort take:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Where lodged the prince that night? and where</q></l>
<l>Lakshmaṇ the brave, and Sítá fair?</l>
<l>Show me the couch whereon he lay,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Tell me the food he ate, I pray.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Guha the Nishádas' king</l>
<l>Replied to Bharat's questioning:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Of all I had I brought the best</q></l>
<l>To serve my good and honoured guest</l>
<l>Food of each varied kind I chose,</l>
<l>And every fairest fruit that grows.</l>
<l>Ráma the hero truly brave</l>
<l>Declined the gift I humbly gave:</l>
<l>His Warrior part he ne'er forgot,</l>
<l>And what I brought accepted not:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">No gifts, my friend, may we accept:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Our law is, Give, and must be kept.</q></l>
<l>The high-souled chief, O Monarch, thus</l>
<l>With gracious words persuaded us.</l>
<l>Then calm and still, absorbed in thought,</l>
<l>He drank the water Lakshmaṇ brought,</l>
<l>And then, obedient to his vows,</l>
<l>He fasted with his gentle spouse.</l>
<l>So Lakshmaṇ too from food abstained,</l>
<pb n="195"/><anchor id="Pg195"/>
<l>And sipped the water that remained:</l>
<l>Then with ruled lips, devoutly staid,</l>
<l>The three<note place="foot">Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, and Sumantra.</note>
their evening worship paid.</l>
<l>Then Lakshmaṇ with unwearied care</l>
<l>Brought heaps of sacred grass, and there</l>
<l>With his own hands he quickly spread,</l>
<l>For Ráma's rest, a pleasant bed,</l>
<l>And faithful Sítá's too, where they</l>
<l>Reclining each by other lay.</l>
<l>Then Lakshmaṇ bathed their feet, and drew</l>
<l>A little distance from the two.</l>
<l>Here stands the tree which lent them shade,</l>
<l>Here is the grass beneath it laid,</l>
<l>Where Ráma and his consort spent</l>
<l>The night together ere they went.</l>
<l>Lakshmaṇ, whose arms the foeman quell,</l>
<l>Watched all the night as sentinel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And kept his great bow strung:</l>
<l>His hand was gloved, his arm was braced,</l>
<l>Two well-filled quivers at his waist,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With deadly arrows, hung.</l>
<l>I took my shafts and trusty bow,</l>
<l>And with that tamer of the foe</l>

<lg>
<l>When Bharat with each friend and peer</l>
<l>Had heard that tale so full and clear,</l>
<l>They went together to the tree</l>
<l>The bed which Ráma pressed to see.</l>
<l>Then Bharat to his mothers said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Behold the high-souled hero's bed:</q></l>
<l>These tumbled heaps of grass betray</l>
<l>Where he that night with Sítá lay:</l>
<l>Unmeet, the heir of fortune high</l>
<l>Thus on the cold bare earth should lie,</l>
<l>The monarch's son, in counsel sage,</l>
<l>Of old imperial lineage.</l>
<l>That lion-lord whose noble bed</l>
<l>With finest skins of deer was spread,—</l>
<l>How can he now endure to press</l>
<l>The bare earth, cold and comfortless!</l>
<l>This sudden fall from bliss to grief</l>
<l>Appears untrue, beyond belief:</l>
<l>My senses are distraught: I seem</l>
<l>To view the fancies of a dream.</l>
<l>There is no deity so great,</l>
<l>No power in heaven can master Fate,</l>
<l>If Ráma, Daśaratha's heir,</l>
<l>Lay on the ground and slumbered there;</l>
<l>And lovely Sítá, she who springs</l>
<l>From fair Videha's ancient kings,</l>
<l>Ráma's dear wife, by all adored,</l>
<l>Lay on the earth beside her lord.</l>
<l>Here was his couch, upon this heap</l>
<l>He tossed and turned in restless sleep:</l>
<l>On the hard soil each manly limb</l>
<l>Has stamped the grass with signs of him.</l>
<l>That night, it seems, fair Sítá spent</l>
<l>Arrayed in every ornament,</l>
<l>For here and there my eyes behold</l>
<l>Small particles of glistering gold.</l>
<l>She laid her outer garment here,</l>
<l>For still some silken threads appear,</l>
<l>How dear in her devoted eyes</l>
<l>Must be the bed where Ráma lies,</l>
<l>Where she so tender could repose</l>
<l>And by his side forget her woes.</l>
<l>Alas, unhappy, guilty me!</l>
<l>For whom the prince was forced to flee,</l>
<l>And chief of Raghu's sons and best,</l>
<l>A bed like this with Sítá pressed.</l>
<l>Son of a royal sire whose hand</l>
<l>Ruled paramount o'er every land,</l>
<l>Could he who every joy bestows,</l>
<l>Whose body like the lotus shows,</l>
<l>The friend of all, who charms the sight,</l>
<l>Whose flashing eyes are darkly bright,</l>
<l>Leave the dear kingdom, his by right,</l>
<l>Unmeet for woe, the heir of bliss,</l>
<l>And lie upon a bed like this?</l>
<l>Great joy and happy fate are thine,</l>
<l>O Lakshmaṇ, marked with each fair sign,</l>
<l>Whose faithful footsteps follow still</l>
<l>Thy brother in his hour of ill.</l>
<l>And blest is Sítá, nobly good,</l>
<l>Who dwells with Ráma in the wood.</l>
<l>Ours is, alas, a doubtful fate</l>
<l>Of Ráma reft and desolate.</l>
<l>My royal sire has gained the skies,</l>
<l>In woods the high-souled hero lies;</l>
<l>The state is wrecked and tempest-tossed,</l>
<l>A vessel with her rudder lost.</l>
<l>Yet none in secret thought has planned</l>
<l>With hostile might to seize the land:</l>
<l>Though forced in distant wilds to dwell,</l>
<l>The hero's arm protects it well.</l>
<l>Unguarded, with deserted wall,</l>
<l>No elephant or steed in stall,</l>
<l>My father's royal city shows</l>
<l>Her portals open to her foes,</l>
<l>Of bold protectors reft and bare,</l>
<l>Defenceless in her dark despair:</l>
<l>But still her foes the wish restrain,</l>
<l>As men from poisoned cates refrain.</l>
<l>I from this hour my nights will pass</l>
<l>Couched on the earth or gathered grass,</l>
<l>Eat only fruit and roots, and wear</l>
<l>A coat of bark, and matted hair.</l>
<l>I in the woods will pass, content,</l>

<head>Canto LXXXIX. The Passage Of Gangá.</head>

<lg>
<l>That night the son of Raghu lay</l>
<l>On Gangá's bank till break of day:</l>
<l>Then with the earliest light he woke</l>
<l>And thus to brave Śatrughna spoke.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Rise up, Śatrughna, from thy bed:</q></l>
<l>Why sleepest thou the night is fled.</l>
<l>See how the sun who chases night</l>
<l>Wakes every lotus with his light.</l>
<l>Arise, arise, and first of all</l>
<l>The lord of Śringavera call,</l>
<l>For he his friendly aid will lend</l>
<l><q rend="post">Our army o'er the flood to send.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus urged, Śatrughna answered: <q rend="pre">I,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Remembering Ráma, sleepless lie.</q></l>
<l>As thus the brothers, each to each,</l>
<l>The lion-mettled, ended speech,</l>
<l>Came Guha, the Nishádas' king,</l>
<l>And spoke with kindly questioning:</l>
<l><q>Hast thou in comfort passed,</q> he cried,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The night upon the river side?</q></l>
<l>With thee how fares it? and are these,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thy soldiers, healthy and at ease?</q></l>
<l>Thus the Nishádas' lord inquired</l>
<l>In gentle words which love inspired,</l>
<l>And Bharat, Ráma's faithful slave,</l>
<l>Thus to the king his answer gave:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The night has sweetly passed, and we</q></l>
<l>Are highly honoured, King, by thee.</l>
<l>Now let thy servants boats prepare,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Our army o'er the stream to bear.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The speech of Bharat Guha heard,</l>
<l>And swift to do his bidding stirred.</l>
<l>Within the town the monarch sped</l>
<l>And to his ready kinsmen said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Awake, each kinsman, rise, each friend!</q></l>
<l>May every joy your lives attend.</l>
<l>Gather each boat upon the shore</l>
<l><q rend="post">And ferry all the army o'er.</q></l>
<l>Thus Guha spoke: nor they delayed,</l>
<l>But, rising quick, their lord obeyed,</l>
<l>And soon, from every side secured,</l>
<l>Five hundred boats were ready moored.</l>
<l>Some reared aloft the mystic sign,<note place="foot">The
<hi rend='italic'>svastika</hi>, a little cross with a
transverse line at each extremity.</note></l>
<l>And mighty bells were hung in line:</l>
<l>Of firmest build, gay flags they bore,</l>
<l>And sailors for the helm and oar.</l>
<l>One such King Guha chose, whereon,</l>
<l>Of fair white cloth, an awning shone,</l>
<l>And sweet musicians charmed the ear,—</l>
<l>And bade his servants urge it near.</l>
<l>Then Bharat swiftly sprang on board,</l>
<l>And then Śatrughna, famous lord,</l>
<l>To whom, with many a royal dame,</l>
<l>Kauśalyá and Sumitrá came.</l>
<l>The household priest went first in place,</l>
<l>The elders, and the Bráhman race,</l>
<l>And after them the monarch's train</l>
<l>Of women borne in many a wain.</l>
<l>Then high to heaven the shouts of those</l>
<l>Who fired the army's huts,<note place="foot">When an army marched it was customary
to burn the huts in which it had spent the night.</note> arose,</l>
<l>With theirs who bathed along the shore,</l>
<l>Or to the boats the baggage bore.</l>
<l>Full freighted with that mighty force</l>
<l>The boats sped swiftly on their course,</l>
<l>By royal Guha's servants manned,</l>
<l>And gentle gales the banners fanned.</l>
<l>Some boats a crowd of dames conveyed,</l>
<l>In others noble coursers neighed;</l>
<l>Some chariots and their cattle bore,</l>
<l>Some precious wealth and golden store.</l>
<l>Across the stream each boat was rowed,</l>
<l>There duly disembarked its load,</l>
<l>And then returning on its way,</l>
<l>Sped here and there in merry play.</l>
<l>Then swimming elephants appeared</l>
<l>With flying pennons high upreared.</l>
<l>And as the drivers urged them o'er,</l>
<l>The look of winged mountains wore.</l>
<l>Some men in barges reached the strand,</l>
<l>Others on rafts came safe to land:</l>
<l>Some buoyed with pitchers crossed the tide,</l>
<l>And others on their arms relied.</l>
<l>Thus with the help the monarch gave</l>
<l>The army crossed pure Gangá's wave:</l>
<l>Then in auspicious hour it stood</l>
<l>Within Prayága's famous wood.</l>
<l>The prince with cheering words addressed</l>
<l>His weary men, and bade them rest</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where'er they chose and he,</l>

<head>Canto XC. The Hermitage.</head>

<lg>
<l>The prince of men a league away</l>
<l>Saw where the hermit's dwelling lay,</l>
<l>Then with his lords his path pursued,</l>
<l>And left his warrior multitude.</l>
<l>On foot, as duty taught his mind,</l>
<l>He left his warlike gear behind;</l>
<l>Two robes of linen cloth he wore,</l>
<l>And bade Vaśishṭha walk before.</l>
<l>Then Bharat from his lords withdrew</l>
<l>When Bharadvája came in view,</l>
<l>And toward the holy hermit went</l>
<l>Behind Vaśishṭha, reverent.</l>
<l>When Bharadvája, saint austere,</l>
<l>Saw good Vaśishṭha drawing near,</l>
<l>He cried, upspringing from his seat,</l>
<l><q>The grace-gift bring, my friend to greet.</q></l>
<l>When Saint Vaśishṭha near him drew,</l>
<l>And Bharat paid the reverence due,</l>
<l>The glorious hermit was aware</l>
<l>That Daśaratha's son was there.</l>
<l>The grace-gift, water for their feet</l>
<l>He gave, and offered fruit to eat;</l>
<l>Then, duty-skilled, with friendly speech</l>
<l>In seemly order questioned each:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">How fares it in Ayodhyá now</q></l>
<l>With treasury and army? how</l>
<l>With kith and kin and friends most dear,</l>
<l><q rend="post">With councillor, and prince, and peer?</q></l>
<l>But, for he knew the king was dead,</l>
<l>Of Daśaratha naught he said.</l>
<l>Vaśishṭha and the prince in turn</l>
<l>Would of the hermit's welfare learn:</l>
<l>Of holy fires they fain would hear,</l>
<l>Of pupils, trees, and birds, and deer.</l>
<l>The glorious saint his answer made</l>
<l>That all was well in holy shade:</l>
<l>Then love of Ráma moved his breast,</l>
<l>And thus he questioned of his guest:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Why art thou here, O Prince, whose band</q></l>
<l>With kingly sway protects the land?</l>
<l>Declare the cause, explain the whole,</l>
<l>For yet some doubt disturbs my soul.</l>
<l>He whom Kauśalyá bare, whose might</l>
<l>The foemen slays, his line's delight,</l>
<l>He who with wife and brother sent</l>
<l>Afar now roam in banishment,</l>
<l>Famed prince, to whom his father spake</l>
<l>This order for a woman's sake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Away! and in the forest spend</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Thy life till fourteen years shall end</q>—</l>
<l>Has thou the wish to harm him, bent</l>
<l>On sin against the innocent?</l>
<l>Wouldst thou thine elder's realm enjoy</l>
<l><q rend="post">Without a thorn that can annoy?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With sobbing voice and tearful eye</l>
<l>Thus Bharat sadly made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah lost am I, if thou, O Saint,</q></l>
<l>Canst thus in thought my heart attaint:</l>
<l>No warning charge from thee I need;</l>
<l>Ne'er could such crime from me proceed.</l>
<l>The words my guilty mother spake</l>
<l>When fondly jealous for my sake—</l>
<l>Think not that I, to triumph moved,</l>
<l>Those words approve or e'er approved.</l>
<l>O Hermit, I have sought this place</l>
<l>To win the lordly hero's grace,</l>
<l>To throw me at my brother's feet</l>
<l>And lead him to his royal seat.</l>
<l>To this, my journey's aim and end,</l>
<l>Thou shouldst, O Saint, thy favour lend:</l>
<l>Where is the lord of earth? do thou,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Most holy, say, where roams he now?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, by the saint Vaśishṭha pressed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">And all the gathered priests beside,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Bharat's dutiful request</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">The hermit graciously replied:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the hermit self-restrained,</l>
<l>With proper tone by rules ordained,</l>
<l>On deepest meditation bent,</l>
<l>In holy might preëminent.</l>
<l>Then as with hands in reverence raised</l>
<l>Absorbed in thought he eastward gazed,</l>
<l>The deities he thus addressed</l>
<l>Came each in semblance manifest.</l>
<l>Delicious gales that cooled the frame</l>
<l>From Malaya and Dardar came,</l>
<l>That kissed those scented hills and threw</l>
<l>Auspicious fragrance where they blew.</l>
<l>Then falling fast in sweetest showers</l>
<l>Came from the sky immortal flowers,</l>
<l>And all the airy region round</l>
<l>With heavenly drums was made to sound.</l>
<l>Then breathed a soft celestial breeze,</l>
<l>Then danced the bright Apsarases,</l>
<l>The minstrels and the Gods advanced,</l>
<l>And warbling lutes the soul entranced.</l>
<l>The earth and sky that music filled,</l>
<l>And through each ear it softly thrilled,</l>
<l>As from the heavenly quills it fell</l>
<l>With time and tune attempered well.</l>
<l>Soon as the minstrels ceased to play</l>
<l>And airs celestial died away,</l>
<l>The troops of Bharat saw amazed</l>
<l>What Viśvakarmá's art had raised.</l>
<l>On every side, five leagues around,</l>
<l>All smooth and level lay the ground,</l>
<l>With fresh green grass that charmed the sight</l>
<l>Like sapphires blent with lazulite.</l>
<l>There the Wood-apple hung its load,</l>
<l>The Mango and the Citron glowed,</l>
<l>The Bel and scented Jak were there,</l>
<l>And Apelá with fruitage fair.</l>
<l>There, brought from Northern Kuru, stood</l>
<l>Rich in delights, the glorious wood,</l>
<l>And many a stream was seen to glide</l>
<pb n="199"/><anchor id="Pg199"/>
<l>With flowering trees along its side.</l>
<l>There mansions rose with four wide halls,</l>
<l>And elephants and chargers' stalls,</l>
<l>And many a house of royal state,</l>
<l>Triumphal arc and bannered gate.</l>
<l>With noble doorways, sought the sky,</l>
<l>Like a pale cloud, a palace high,</l>
<l>Which far and wide rare fragrance shed,</l>
<l>With wreaths of white engarlanded.</l>
<l>Square was its shape, its halls were wide,</l>
<l>With many a seat and couch supplied,</l>
<l>Drink of all kinds, and every meat</l>
<l>Such as celestial Gods might eat.</l>
<l>Then at the bidding of the seer</l>
<l>Kaikeyí's strong-armed son drew near,</l>
<l>And passed within that fair abode</l>
<l>Which with the noblest jewels glowed.</l>
<l>Then, as Vaśishṭha led the way,</l>
<l>The councillors, in due array,</l>
<l>Followed delighted and amazed</l>
<l>And on the glorious structure gazed.</l>
<l>Then Bharat, Raghu's son, drew near</l>
<l>The kingly throne, with prince and peer,</l>
<l>Whereby the chouri in the shade</l>
<l>Of the white canopy was laid.</l>
<l>Before the throne he humbly bent</l>
<l>And honoured Ráma, reverent,</l>
<l>Then in his hand the chouri bore,</l>
<l>And sat where sits a councillor.</l>
<l>His ministers and household priest</l>
<l>Sat by degrees from chief to least,</l>
<l>Then sat the captain of the host</l>
<l>And all the men he honoured most.</l>
<l>Then when the saint his order gave,</l>
<l>Each river with enchanted wave</l>
<l>Rolled milk and curds divinely sweet</l>
<l>Before the princely Bharat's feet;</l>
<l>And dwellings fair on either side,</l>
<l>With gay white plaster beautified,</l>
<l>Their heavenly roofs were seen to lift,</l>
<l>The Bráhman Bharadvája's gift.</l>
<l>Then straight by Lord Kuvera sent,</l>
<l>Gay with celestial ornament</l>
<l>Of bright attire and jewels' shine,</l>
<l>Came twenty thousand nymphs divine:</l>
<l>The man on whom those beauties glanced</l>
<l>That moment felt his soul entranced.</l>
<l>With them from Nandan's blissful shades</l>
<l>Came twenty thousand heavenly maids.</l>
<l>Tumburu, Nárad, Gopa came,</l>
<l>And Sutanu, like radiant flame,</l>
<l>The kings of the Gandharva throng,</l>
<l>And ravished Bharat with their song.</l>
<l>Then spoke the saint, and swift obeyed</l>
<l>Alambúshá, the fairest maid,</l>
<l>And Miśrakeśí bright to view,</l>
<l>Ramaṇá, Puṇḍríká too,</l>
<l>And danced to him with graceful ease</l>
<l>The dances of Apsarases.</l>
<l>All chaplets that by Gods are worn,</l>
<l>Or Chaitraratha's graves adorn,</l>
<l>Bloomed by the saint's command arrayed</l>
<l>On branches in Prayága's shade.</l>
<l>When at the saint's command the breeze</l>
<l>Made music with the Vilva trees,</l>
<l>To wave in rhythmic beat began</l>
<l>The boughs of each Myrobolan,</l>
<l>And holy fig-trees wore the look</l>
<l>Of dancers, as their leaflets shook.</l>
<l>The fair Tamála, palm, and pine,</l>
<l>With trees that tower and plants that twine,</l>
<l>The sweetly varying forms displayed</l>
<l>Of stately dame or bending maid.</l>
<l>Here men the foaming winecup quaffed,</l>
<l>Here drank of milk full many a draught,</l>
<l>And tasted meats of every kind,</l>
<l>Well dressed, whatever pleased their mind.</l>
<l>Then beauteous women, seven or eight,</l>
<l>Stood ready by each man to wait:</l>
<l>Beside the stream his limbs they stripped</l>
<l>And in the cooling water dipped.</l>
<l>And then the fair ones, sparkling eyed,</l>
<l>With soft hands rubbed his limbs and dried,</l>
<l>And sitting on the lovely bank</l>
<l>Held up the winecup as he drank.</l>
<l>Nor did the grooms forget to feed</l>
<l>Camel and mule and ox and steed,</l>
<l>For there were stores of roasted grain,</l>
<l>Of honey and of sugar-cane.</l>
<l>So fast the wild excitement spread</l>
<l>Among the warriors Bharat led,</l>
<l>That all the mighty army through</l>
<l>The groom no more his charger knew,</l>
<l>And he who drove might seek in vain</l>
<l>To tell his elephant again.</l>
<l>With every joy and rapture fired,</l>
<l>Entranced with all the heart desired,</l>
<l>The myriads of the host that night</l>
<l>Revelled delirious with delight.</l>
<l>Urged by the damsels at their side</l>
<l>In wild delight the warriors cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ne'er will we seek Ayodhyá, no,</q></l>
<l>Nor yet to Daṇḍak forest go:</l>
<l>Here will we stay: may happy fate</l>
<l><q rend="post">On Bharat and on Ráma wait.</q></l>
<l>Thus cried the army gay and free</l>
<l>Exulting in their lawless glee,</l>
<l>Both infantry and those who rode</l>
<l>On elephants, or steeds bestrode,</l>
<l>Ten thousand voices shouting, <q rend="pre">This</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Is heaven indeed for perfect bliss.</q></l>
<l>With garlands decked they idly strayed,</l>
<l>And danced and laughed and sang and played.</l>
<l>At length as every soldier eyed,</l>
<l>With food like Amrit satisfied,</l>
<l>Each dainty cate and tempting meat,</l>
<l>No longer had he care to eat.</l>
<l>Thus soldier, servant, dame, and slave</l>
<l>Received whate'er the wish might crave.</l>
<l>As each in new-wrought clothes arrayed</l>
<l>Enjoyed the feast before him laid.</l>
<pb n="200"/><anchor id="Pg200"/>
<l>Each man was seen in white attire</l>
<l>Unstained by spot or speck of mire:</l>
<l>None was athirst or hungry there,</l>

<l>On every side in woody dells</l>
<l>Was milky food in bubbling wells,</l>
<l>And there were all-supplying cows</l>
<l>And honey dropping from the boughs.</l>
<l>Nor wanted lakes of flower-made drink</l>
<l>With piles of meat upon the brink,</l>
<l>Boiled, stewed, and roasted, varied cheer,</l>
<l>Peachick and jungle-fowl and deer,</l>
<l>There was the flesh of kid and boar,</l>
<l>And dainty sauce in endless store,</l>
<l>With juice of flowers concocted well,</l>
<l>And soup that charmed the taste and smell,</l>
<l>And pounded fruits of bitter taste,</l>
<l>And many a bath was ready placed</l>
<l>Down by each river's shelving side</l>
<l>There stood great basins well supplied,</l>
<l>And laid therein, of dazzling sheen,</l>
<l>White brushes for the teeth were seen,</l>
<l>And many a covered box wherein</l>
<l>Was sandal powdered for the skin.</l>
<l>And mirrors bright with constant care,</l>
<l>And piles of new attire were there,</l>
<l>And store of sandals and of shoes,</l>
<l>Thousands of pairs, for all to choose:</l>
<l>Eye-unguents, combs for hair and beard,</l>
<l>Umbrellas fair and bows appeared.</l>
<l>Lakes gleamed, that lent digestive aid,<note place="foot">The poet does not tell
us what these lakes contained.</note></l>
<l>And some for pleasant bathing made,</l>
<l>With waters fair, and smooth incline</l>
<l>For camels, horses, mules, and kine.</l>
<l>There saw they barley heaped on high</l>
<l>The countless cattle to supply:</l>
<l>The golden grain shone fair and bright</l>
<l>As sapphires or the lazulite.</l>
<l>To all the gathered host it seemed</l>
<l>As if that magic scene they dreamed,</l>

<l>At Bharadvája's glorious feast.</l>
</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in the hermit's grove they spent</l>
<l>That night in joy and merriment,</l>

<lg>
<l>So Bharat with his army spent</l>
<l>The watches of the night content,</l>
<l>And gladly, with the morning's light</l>
<l>Drew near his host the anchorite.</l>
<l>When Bharadvája saw him stand</l>
<l>With hand in reverence joined to hand,</l>
<l>When fires of worship had been fed,</l>
<l>He looked upon the prince and said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O blameless son, I pray thee tell,</q></l>
<l>Did the past night content thee well?</l>
<l>Say if the feast my care supplied</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thy host of followers gratified.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hands he joined, his head he bent</l>
<l>And spoke in answer reverent</l>
<l>To the most high and radiant sage</l>
<l>Who issued from his hermitage:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Well have I passed the night: thy feast</q></l>
<l>Gave joy to every man and beast;</l>
<l>And I, great lord, and every peer</l>
<l>Were satisfied with sumptuous cheer,</l>
<l>Thy banquet has delighted all</l>
<l>From highest chief to meanest thrall,</l>
<l>And rich attire and drink and meat</l>
<l>Banished the thought of toil and heat.</l>
<l>And now, O Hermit good and great,</l>
<l>A boon of thee I supplicate.</l>
<l>To Ráma's side my steps I bend:</l>
<l>Do thou with friendly eye commend.</l>
<l>O tell me how to guide my feet</l>
<l>To virtuous Ráma's lone retreat:</l>
<l>Great Hermit, I entreat thee, say</l>
<l><q rend="post">How far from here and which the way.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by fraternal love inspired</l>
<l>The chieftain of the saint inquired:</l>
<l>Then thus replied the glorious seer</l>
<l>Of matchless might, of vows austere:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ere the fourth league from here be passed,</q></l>
<l>Amid a forest wild and vast,</l>
<l>Stands Chitrakúṭa's mountain tall,</l>
<l>Lovely with wood and waterfall.</l>
<l>North of the mountain thou wilt see</l>
<l>The beauteous stream Mandákiní,</l>
<l>Where swarm the waterfowl below,</l>
<l>And gay trees on the margin grow.</l>
<l>Then will a leafy cot between</l>
<l>The river and the hill be seen:</l>
<l>'Tis Ráma's, and the princely pair</l>
<l>Of brothers live for certain there.</l>
<l>Hence to the south thine army lead,</l>
<l>And then more southward still proceed,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as the ordered march they knew,</l>
<l>The widows of the monarch flew,</l>
<l>Leaving their cars, most meet to ride,</l>
<l>And flocked to Bharadvája's side.</l>
<l>There with the good Sumitrá Queen</l>
<l>Kauśalyá, sad and worn, was seen,</l>
<l>Caressing, still with sorrow faint,</l>
<l>The feet of that illustrious saint,</l>
<l>Kaikeyí too, her longings crossed,</l>
<l>Reproached of all, her object lost,</l>
<l>Before the famous hermit came,</l>

<l>And clasped his feet, o'erwhelmed with shame.</l>
<l>With circling steps she humbly went</l>
<l>Around the saint preëminent,</l>

<l>With heart oppressed, and heavy-eyed.</l>
<l>Then the great seer, who never broke</l>
<l>One holy vow, to Bharat spoke:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Obedient to the high request</l>
<l>By Bharadvája thus addressed,</l>
<l>His reverent hands together laid,</l>

<l>The all-preserving Vishṇu bore,</l>
<l>Kauśalyá bore with happy fate</l>
<l>Lord Ráma of the lion's gait.</l>
<l>She who, transfixed with torturing pangs,</l>
<l>On her left arm so fondly hangs,</l>
<l>As when her withering leaves decay</l>
<l>Droops by the wood the Cassia spray,</l>
<l>Sumitrá, pained with woe, is she,</l>
<l>The consort second of the three:</l>
<l>Two princely sons the lady bare,</l>
<l>Fair as the Gods in heaven are fair.</l>
<l>And she, the wicked dame through whom</l>
<l>My brothers' lives are wrapped in gloom,</l>
<l>And mourning for his offspring dear,</l>
<l>The king has sought his heavenly sphere,—</l>
<l>Proud, foolish-hearted, swift to ire,</l>
<l>Self-fancied darling of my sire,</l>
<l>Kaikeyí, most ambitious queen,</l>
<l>Unlovely with her lovely mien,</l>
<l>My mother she, whose impious will</l>
<l>Is ever bent on deeds of ill,</l>
<l>In whom the root and spring I see</l>
<l><q rend="post">Of all this woe which crushes me.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Quick breathing like a furious snake,</l>
<l>With tears and sobs the hero spake,</l>
<l>With reddened eyes aglow with rage.</l>
<l>And Bharadvája, mighty sage,</l>
<l>Supreme in wisdom, calm and grave,</l>
<l>In words like these good counsel gave:</l>

<l>And Bharat, with that promise cheered,</l>
<l>Went circling round that saint revered,</l>

<l>Prompt at the summons thousands flew</l>
<l>To cars which noble coursers drew,</l>

<l>Marched with their bright bells' tinkling chime</l>
<l>Like clouds when ends the summer time:</l>
<l>Some cars were huge and some were light,</l>
<l>For heavy draught or rapid flight,</l>

<l>The dames, Kauśalyá at their head,</l>

<l>As through the woods its way pursued</l>
<l>That mighty bannered multitude,</l>
<l>Wild elephants in terror fled</l>
<l>With all the startled herds they led,</l>
<l>And bears and deer were seen on hill,</l>
<l>In forest glade, by every rill.</l>
<l>Wide as the sea from coast to coast,</l>
<l>The high-souled Bharat's mighty host</l>

<l>The stately elephants he led,</l>

<l>The trees their rain of blossoms shed</l>
<l>On table-lands beneath them spread,</l>

<l>And horses browse beneath the steep,</l>
<l>Countless as monsters in the deep.</l>
<l>Scared by my host the mountain deer</l>
<l>Starting with tempest speed appear</l>
<l>Like the long lines of cloud that fly</l>
<l>In autumn through the windy sky.</l>
<l>See, every warrior shows his head</l>
<l>With fragrant blooms engarlanded;</l>
<l>All look like southern soldiers who</l>
<l>Lift up their shields of azure hue.</l>
<l>This lonely wood beneath the hill,</l>
<l>That was so dark and drear and still,</l>
<l>Covered with men in endless streams</l>
<l>Now like Ayodhyá's city seems.</l>
<l>The dust which countless hoofs excite</l>
<l>Obscures the sky and veils the light;</l>
<l>But see, swift winds those clouds dispel</l>
<l>As if they strove to please me well.</l>
<l>See, guided in their swift career</l>
<l>By many a skilful charioteer,</l>

<l>Thus Ráma showed to Janak's child</l>
<l>The varied beauties of the wild,</l>
<l>The hill, the brook and each fair spot,</l>
<l>Then turned to seek their leafy cot.</l>
<l>North of the mountain Ráma found</l>
<l>A cavern in the sloping ground,</l>
<l>Charming to view, its floor was strown</l>
<l>With many a mass of ore and stone,</l>
<l>In secret shadow far retired</l>
<l>Where gay birds sang with joy inspired,</l>
<l>And trees their graceful branches swayed</l>
<l>With loads of blossom downward weighed.</l>
<l>Soon as he saw the cave which took</l>
<l>Each living heart and chained the look,</l>
<l>Thus Ráma spoke to Sítá who</l>
<l>Gazed wondering on the silvan view:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Does this fair cave beneath the height,</q></l>
<l>Videhan lady, charm thy sight?</l>
<l>Then let us resting here a while</l>
<l>The languor of the way beguile.</l>
<l>That block of stone so smooth and square</l>
<l>Was set for thee to rest on there,</l>
<l>And like a thriving Keśar tree</l>
<l><q rend="post">This flowery shrub o'ershadows thee.</q></l>
<l>Thus Ráma spoke, and Janak's child,</l>
<l>By nature ever soft and mild,</l>
<l>In tender words which love betrayed</l>
<l>Her answer to the hero made:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O pride of Raghu's children, still</q></l>
<l>My pleasure is to do thy will.</l>
<l>Enough for me thy wish to know:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Far hast thou wandered to and fro.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Sítá spake in gentle tone,</l>
<l>And went obedient to the stone,</l>
<l>Of perfect face and faultless limb</l>
<l>Prepared to rest a while with him.</l>
<l>And Ráma, as she thus replied,</l>
<l>Turned to his spouse again and cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thou seest, love, this flowery shade</q></l>
<l>For silvan creatures' pleasure made,</l>
<l>How the gum streams from trees and plants</l>
<l>Torn by the tusks of elephants!</l>
<pb n="205"/><anchor id="Pg205"/>
<l>Through all the forest clear and high</l>
<l>Resounds the shrill cicala's cry.</l>
<l>Hark how the kite above us moans,</l>
<l>And calls her young in piteous tones;</l>
<l>So may my hapless mother be</l>
<l>Still mourning in her home for me.</l>
<l>There mounted on that lofty Sál</l>
<l>The loud Bhringráj<note place="foot">A fine bird with a strong, sweet note,

<l>How sweetly now he tunes his throat</l>
<l>Responsive to the Koïl's note.</l>
<l>Or else the bird that now has sung</l>
<l>May be himself the Koïl's young,</l>
<l>Linked with such winning sweetness are</l>
<l>The notes he pours irregular.</l>
<l>See, round the blooming Mango clings</l>
<l>That creeper with her tender rings,</l>
<l>So in thy love, when none is near,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thine arms are thrown round me, my dear.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in his joy he cried; and she,</l>
<l>Sweet speaker, on her lover's knee,</l>
<l>Of faultless limb and perfect face,</l>
<l>Grew closer to her lord's embrace.</l>
<l>Reclining in her husband's arms,</l>
<l>A goddess in her wealth of charms,</l>
<l>She filled his loving breast anew</l>
<l>With mighty joy that thrilled him through.</l>
<l>His finger on the rock he laid,</l>
<l>Which veins of sanguine ore displayed,</l>
<l>And painted o'er his darling's eyes</l>
<l>The holy sign in mineral dyes.</l>
<l>Bright on her brow the metal lay</l>
<l>Like the young sun's first gleaming ray,</l>
<l>And showed her in her beauty fair</l>
<l>As the soft light of morning's air.</l>
<l>Then from the Keśar's laden tree</l>
<l>He picked fair blossoms in his glee,</l>
<l>And as he decked each lovely tress,</l>
<l>His heart o'erflowed with happiness.</l>
<l>So resting on that rocky seat</l>
<l>A while they spent in pastime sweet,</l>
<l>Then onward neath the shady boughs</l>
<l>Went Ráma with his Maithil spouse.</l>
<l>She roaming in the forest shade</l>
<l>Where every kind of creature strayed</l>
<l>Observed a monkey wandering near,</l>
<l>And clung to Ráma's arm in fear.</l>
<l>The hero Ráma fondly laced</l>
<l>His mighty arms around her waist,</l>
<l>Consoled his beauty in her dread,</l>
<l>And scared the Monkey till he fled.</l>
<l>That holy mark of sanguine ore</l>
<l>That gleamed on Sítá's brow before,</l>
<l>Shone by that close embrace impressed</l>
<l>Upon the hero's ample chest.</l>
<l>Then Sítá, when the beast who led</l>
<l>The monkey troop, afar had fled,</l>
<l>Laughed loudly in light-hearted glee</l>
<l>That mark on Ráma's chest to see.</l>
<l>A clump of bright Aśokas fired</l>
<l>The forest in their bloom attired:</l>
<l>The restless blossoms as they gleamed</l>
<l>A host of threatening monkeys seemed.</l>
<l>Then Sítá thus to Ráma cried,</l>
<l>As longingly the flowers she eyed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Pride of thy race, now let us go</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Where those Aśoka blossoms grow.</q></l>
<l>He on his darling's pleasure bent</l>
<l>With his fair goddess thither went</l>
<l>And roamed delighted through the wood</l>
<l>Where blossoming Aśokas stood,</l>
<l>As Śiva with Queen Umá roves</l>
<l>Through Himaván's majestic groves.</l>
<l>Bright with purpureal glow the pair</l>
<l>Of happy lovers sported there,</l>
<l>And each upon the other set</l>
<l>A flower-inwoven coronet.</l>
<l>There many a crown and chain they wove</l>
<l>Of blooms from that Aśoka grove,</l>
<l>And in their graceful sport the two</l>
<l>Fresh beauty o'er the mountain threw.</l>
<l>The lover let his love survey</l>
<l>Each pleasant spot that round them lay,</l>
<l>Then turned they to their green retreat</l>
<l>Where all was garnished, gay, and neat.</l>
<l>By brotherly affection led,</l>
<l>Sumitrá's son to meet them sped,</l>
<l>And showed the labours of the day</l>
<l>Done while his brother was away.</l>
<l>There lay ten black-deer duly slain</l>
<l>With arrows pure of poison stain,</l>
<l>Piled in a mighty heap to dry,</l>
<l>With many another carcass nigh.</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ's brother saw, o'erjoyed,</l>
<l>The work that had his hands employed,</l>
<l>Then to his consort thus he cried:</l>
<l><q>Now be the general gifts supplied.</q></l>
<l>Then Sítá, fairest beauty, placed</l>
<l>The food for living things to taste,</l>
<l>And set before the brothers meat</l>
<l>And honey that the pair might eat.</l>
<l>They ate the meal her hands supplied,</l>
<l>Their lips with water purified:</l>
<l>Then Janak's daughter sat at last</l>
<l>And duly made her own repast.</l>
<l>The other venison, to be dried,</l>
<l>Piled up in heaps was set aside,</l>
<l>And Ráma told his wife to stay</l>
<l>And drive the flocking crows away.</l>
<l>Her husband saw her much distressed</l>
<l>By one more bold than all the rest,</l>
<l>Whose wings where'er he chose could fly,</l>
<l>Now pierce the earth, now roam the sky.</l>
<l>Then Ráma laughed to see her stirred</l>
<l>To anger by the plaguing bird:</l>
<l>Proud of his love the beauteous dame</l>
<l>With burning rage was all aflame.</l>
<l>Now here, now there, again, again</l>
<l>She chased the crow, but all in vain,</l>
<l>Enraging her, so quick to strike</l>
<pb n="206"/><anchor id="Pg206"/>
<l>With beak and wing and claw alike:</l>
<l>Then how the proud lip quivered, how</l>
<l>The dark frown marked her angry brow!</l>
<l>When Ráma saw her cheek aglow</l>
<l>With passion, he rebuked the crow.</l>
<l>But bold in impudence the bird,</l>
<l>With no respect for Ráma's word,</l>
<l>Fearless again at Sítá flew:</l>
<l>Then Ráma's wrath to fury grew.</l>
<l>The hero of the mighty arm</l>
<l>Spoke o'er a shaft the mystic charm,</l>
<l>Laid the dire weapon on his bow</l>
<l>And launched it at the shameless crow.</l>
<l>The bird, empowered by Gods to spring</l>
<l>Through earth itself on rapid wing,</l>
<l>Through the three worlds in terror fled</l>
<l>Still followed by that arrow dread.</l>
<l>Where'er he flew, now here now there,</l>
<l>A cloud of weapons filled the air.</l>
<l>Back to the high-souled prince he fled</l>
<l>And bent at Ráma's feet his head,</l>
<l>And then, as Sítá looked, began</l>
<l>His speech in accents of a man:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O pardon, and for pity's sake</q></l>
<l>Spare, Ráma, spare my life to take!</l>
<l>Where'er I turn, where'er I flee,</l>
<l><q rend="post">No shelter from this shaft I see.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chieftain heard the crow entreat</l>
<l>Helpless and prostrate at his feet,</l>
<l>And while soft pity moved his breast,</l>
<l>With wisest speech the bird addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I took the troubled Sítá's part,</q></l>
<l>And furious anger filled my heart.</l>
<l>Then on the string my arrow lay</l>
<l>Charmed with a spell thy life to slay.</l>
<l>Thou seekest now my feet, to crave</l>
<l>Forgiveness and thy life to save.</l>
<l>So shall thy prayer have due respect:</l>
<l>The suppliant I must still protect.</l>
<l>But ne'er in vain this dart may flee;</l>
<l>Yield for thy life a part of thee,</l>
<l>What portion of thy body, say,</l>
<l>Shall this mine arrow rend away?</l>
<l>Thus far, O bird, thus far alone</l>
<l>On thee my pity may be shown.</l>
<l>Forfeit a part thy life to buy:</l>
<l><q rend="post">'Tis better so to live than die.</q></l>
<l>Thus Ráma spoke: the bird of air</l>
<l>Pondered his speech with anxious care,</l>
<l>And wisely deemed it good to give</l>
<l>One of his eyes that he might live.</l>
<l>To Raghu's son he made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Ráma, I will yield an eye.</q></l>
<l>So let me in thy grace confide</l>
<l><q rend="post">And live hereafter single-eyed.</q></l>
<l>Then Ráma charged the shaft, and lo,</l>
<l>Full in the eye it smote the crow.</l>
<l>And the Videhan lady gazed</l>
<l>Upon the ruined eye amazed.</l>
<l>The crow to Ráma humbly bent,</l>
<l>Then where his fancy led he went.</l>

<l>No fault is his who slays the foe</l>

<l>The queen athirst for royal sway</l>

<lg>
<l>Then Ráma nobly calm allayed</l>
<l>The wrath that Lakshmaṇ's bosom swayed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What need have we the sword to wield,</q></l>
<l>To bend the bow or lift the shield,</l>
<l>If Bharat brave, and wise, and good,</l>
<l>Himself has sought this sheltering wood?</l>
<l>I sware my father's will to do,</l>
<l>And if I now my brother slew</l>
<l>What gain in kingship should I find,</l>
<l>Despised and scorned by all mankind?</l>
<l>Believe me, e'en as I would shrink</l>
<l>From poisoned meat or deadly drink,</l>
<l>No power or treasure would I win</l>
<l>By fall of friend or kith or kin.</l>
<l>Brother, believe the words I speak:</l>
<l>For your dear sakes alone I seek</l>
<l>Duty and pleasure, wealth and gain:</l>
<l>A holy life, a happy reign.</l>
<l>If royal sway my heart desires,</l>
<l>My brothers' weal the wish inspires:</l>
<l>Their bliss and safety is my care,</l>
<l>By this uplifted bow I swear.</l>
<l>'Twere not so hard for me to gain</l>
<l>This broad land girdled by the main,</l>
<l>But even Indra's royal might</l>
<l>Should ne'er be mine in duty's spite.</l>
<l>If any bliss my soul can see</l>
<l>Deprived of dear Śatrughna, thee,</l>
<l>And Bharat, may the flame destroy</l>
<l>With ashy gloom the selfish joy.</l>
<l>Far dearer than this life of mine,</l>
<l>Knowing the custom of our line,</l>
<l>His heart with fond affection fraught,</l>
<l>Bharat Ayodhyá's town resought</l>
<l>And hearing when he came that I,</l>
<l>With thee and Sítá, forced to fly</l>
<l>With matted hair and hermit dress</l>
<l>Am wandering in the wilderness.</l>
<l>While grief his troubled senses storms,</l>
<l>And tender love his bosom warms,</l>
<l>From every thought of evil clear,</l>
<l>Is come to meet his brother here.</l>
<l>Some grievous words perchance he spoke</l>
<l>Kaikeyí's anger to provoke,</l>
<l>Then won the king, and comes to lay</l>
<l>Before my feet the royal sway.</l>
<l>Hither, methinks, in season due</l>
<l>Comes Bharat for an interview,</l>
<l>Nor in his secret heart has he</l>
<l>One evil thought 'gainst thee or me.</l>
<l>What has he done ere now, reflect!</l>
<l>How failed in love or due respect</l>
<pb n="208"/><anchor id="Pg208"/>
<l>To make thee doubt his faith and lay</l>

<l>Thou shouldst not join with Bharat's name</l>

<l>The blows thy tongue at Bharat deals,</l>

<l>How, urged by stress of any ill,</l>
<l>Should sons their father's life-blood spill,</l>
<l>Or brother slay in impious strife</l>
<l>A brother dearer than his life?</l>
<l>If thou these cruel words hast said</l>
<l>By strong desire of empire led,</l>

<l>He thinks on all our care and pain,</l>
<l>And now would lead us home again.</l>
<l>My glorious father hence will bear</l>
<l>Sítá who claims all tender care.</l>
<l>I see two coursers fleet as storms,</l>

<l>I see the beast of mountain size</l>
<l>Who bears the king our father wise,</l>

<l>With bow, sword, arrows in their hands</l>
<l>Let Guha with his kindred bands</l>
<l>Within this grove remaining trace</l>
<l>The children of Kakutstha's race.</l>
<l>And I meanwhile on foot will through</l>

<l>There is, I feel, no rest for me</l>

<l>None, till my kingly brother gain</l>
<l>His old hereditary reign,</l>

<l>The consecrating drops be shed.</l>
<l>How blest is Janak's daughter, true</l>

<lg>
<l>Then Bharat to Śatrughna showed</l>
<l>The spot, and eager onward strode,</l>
<l>First bidding Saint Vaśishṭha bring</l>
<l>The widowed consorts of the king.</l>
<l>As by fraternal love impelled</l>
<l>His onward course the hero held,</l>
<l>Sumantra followed close behind</l>
<l>Śatrughna with an anxious mind:</l>
<l>Not Bharat's self more fain could be</l>
<l>To look on Ráma's face than he.</l>
<l>As, speeding on, the spot he neared,</l>
<l>Amid the hermits' homes appeared</l>
<l>His brother's cot with leaves o'erspread,</l>
<l>And by its side a lowly shed.</l>
<l>Before the shed great heaps were left</l>
<l>Of gathered flowers and billets cleft,</l>
<l>And on the trees hung grass and bark</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ's path to mark:</l>
<l>And heaps of fuel to provide</l>
<l>Against the cold stood ready dried.</l>
<l>The long-armed chief, as on he went</l>
<l>In glory's light preëminent,</l>
<l>With joyous words like these addressed</l>
<l>The brave Śatrughna and the rest:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This is the place, I little doubt,</q></l>
<l>Which Bharadvája pointed out,</l>
<l>Not far from where we stand must be</l>
<l>The woodland stream, Mandákiní.</l>
<l>Here on the mountain's woody side</l>
<l>Roam elephants in tusked pride,</l>
<l>And ever with a roar and cry</l>
<l>Each other, as they meet, defy.</l>
<l>And see those smoke-wreaths thick and dark:</l>
<l>The presence of the flame they mark,</l>
<l>Which hermits in the forest strive</l>
<l>By every art to keep alive.</l>
<l>O happy me! my task is done,</l>
<l>And I shall look on Raghu's son,</l>
<l>Like some great saint, who loves to treat</l>
<l><q rend="post">His elders with all reverence meet.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Bharat reached that forest rill,</l>
<l>Thus roamed on Chitrakúṭa's hill;</l>
<l>Then pity in his breast awoke,</l>
<l>And to his friends the hero spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Woe, woe upon my life and birth!</q></l>
<l>The prince of men, the lord of earth</l>
<l>Has sought the lonely wood to dwell</l>
<l>Sequestered in a hermit's cell.</l>
<l>Through me, through me these sorrows fall</l>
<l>On him the splendid lord of all:</l>
<l>Through me resigning earthly bliss</l>
<l>He hides him in a home like this.</l>
<l>Now will I, by the world abhorred,</l>
<l>Fall at the dear feet of my lord,</l>
<l>And at fair Sítá's too, to win</l>
<l><q rend="post">His pardon for my heinous sin.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus he sadly mourned and sighed,</l>
<l>The son of Daśaratha spied</l>
<l>A bower of leafy branches made,</l>
<l>Sacred and lovely in the shade,</l>
<l>Of fair proportions large and tall,</l>
<l>Well roofed with boughs of palm, and Sál,</l>
<l>Arranged in order due o'erhead</l>
<l>Like grass upon an altar spread.</l>
<l>Two glorious bows were gleaming there,</l>
<l>Like Indra's<note place="foot">The rainbow is called the bow of Indra.</note>
in the rainy air,</l>
<l>Terror of foemen, backed with gold,</l>
<l>Meet for the mightiest hand to hold:</l>
<l>And quivered arrows cast a blaze</l>
<l>Bright gleaming like the Day-God's rays:</l>
<l>Thus serpents with their eyes aglow</l>
<l>Adorn their capital below.<note place="foot">Bhogavatí, the abode of the Nágas or
Serpent race.</note></l>
<l>Great swords adorned the cottage, laid</l>
<l>Each in a case of gold brocade;</l>
<l>There hung the trusty shields, whereon</l>
<l>With purest gold the bosses shone.</l>
<l>The brace to bind the bowman's arm,</l>
<l>The glove to shield his hand from harm,</l>
<l>A lustre to the cottage lent</l>
<l>From many a golden ornament:</l>
<l>Safe was the cot from fear of men</l>
<l>As from wild beasts the lion's den.</l>
<l>The fire upon the altar burned,</l>
<l>That to the north and east was turned.</l>
<l>Bharat his eager glances bent</l>
<l>And gazed within the cot intent;</l>
<l>In deerskin dress, with matted hair,</l>
<l>Ráma his chief was sitting there:</l>
<l>With lion-shoulders broad and strong,</l>
<l>With lotus eyes, arms thick and long.</l>
<l>The righteous sovereign, who should be</l>
<l>Lord paramount from sea to sea,</l>
<l>High-minded, born to lofty fate,</l>
<l>Like Brahmá's self supremely great;</l>
<l>With Lakshmaṇ by his side, and her,</l>
<l>Fair Sítá, for his minister.</l>
<l>And Bharat gazing, overcome</l>
<l>By sorrow for a while was dumb,</l>
<l>Then, yielding to his woe, he ran</l>
<l>To Ráma and with sobs began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">He who a royal seat should fill</q></l>
<l>With subjects round to do his will,</l>
<l>My elder brother,—see him here,</l>
<l>With silvan creatures waiting near.</l>
<l>The high-souled hero, wont to wear</l>
<l>The costliest robes exceeding fair,</l>
<l>Now banished, in a deerskin dress,</l>
<l>Here keeps the path of righteousness.</l>
<l>How brooks the son of Raghu now</l>
<l>The matted locks which load his brow,</l>
<l>Around whose princely head were twined</l>
<l>Sweet blossoms of the rarest kind?</l>
<l>The prince whose merits grew, acquired</l>
<pb n="210"/><anchor id="Pg210"/>
<l>By rites performed as he desired,</l>
<l>Would now a store of merit gain</l>
<l>Bought by his body's toil and pain.</l>
<l>Those limbs to which pure sandal lent</l>
<l>The freshness of its fragrant scent,</l>
<l>Exposed to sun, and dust, and rain,</l>
<l>Are now defiled with many a stain.</l>
<l>And I the wretched cause why this</l>

<l><q rend="post">To be the people's hate and scorn!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Bharat cried: of anguish sprung,</l>
<l>Great drops upon his forehead hung.</l>
<l>He fell o'erpowered—his grief was such—</l>
<l>Ere he his brother's feet could touch.</l>
<l>As on the glorious prince he gazed</l>
<l>In vain his broken voice he raised:</l>
<l><q>Dear lord</q>—through tears and sobbing came,</l>
<l>The only words his lips could frame.</l>
<l>And brave Śatrughna wept aloud,</l>
<l>As low at Ráma's feet he bowed.</l>
<l>Then Ráma, while his tears ran fast,</l>
<l>His arms around his brothers cast.</l>
<l>Guha, Sumantra came to meet</l>
<l>The princes in their wild retreat.</l>

<l>Athirst for sway, her hopes are crossed,</l>

<l>For punishment to hell below.</l>
<l>Now O my lord, forgive me all;</l>

<l>Let the full moon of autumn reign</l>

<l>O do not thou this grace deny:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As weeping thus the hero prayed,</l>
<l>His head at Ráma's feet he laid.</l>
<l>Like a mad elephant he sighed:</l>

<l><q rend="pre">How, brother, can a man of worth,</q></l>
<l>True to his vows, of noble birth—</l>
<l>A man like me, commit a sin</l>
<l>The lordship of the land to win?</l>
<l>No slightest shade of fault I see,</l>
<l>O tamer of thy foes, in thee.</l>
<l>But ne'er shouldst thou in childish thought</l>
<l>The queen thy mother blame in aught.</l>
<l>O brother wise and sinless, know</l>
<l>The sacred laws would have it so,</l>
<l>That from good wife and son require</l>
<l>Obedience to their lord and sire.</l>
<l>And we are all the king's, for thus</l>
<l>The virtuous ever reckon us:</l>
<l>Yea brother, be it known to thee,</l>
<l>His wives, and sons, and pupils we.</l>
<l>His is the right, if he deem fit,</l>
<l>To bid me, throned as monarch, sit,</l>
<l>Or in a coat of bark expel,</l>

<l>And O remember, best of all</l>
<l>Who act as claims of duty call,</l>
<l>As to a virtuous sire is due,</l>
<l>Such honour claims a mother too.</l>
<l>So they whose lives have ever been</l>
<l>By duty led, the king and queen,</l>

<head>Canto CIII. The Funeral Libation.</head>

<lg>
<l>When Ráma heard from Bharat each</l>
<l>Dark sorrow of his mournful speech,</l>
<l>And tidings of his father dead,</l>
<l>His spirits fell, his senses fled.</l>
<l>For the sad words his brother spoke</l>
<l>Struck on him like a thunder stroke,</l>
<l>Fierce as the bolt which Indra throws,</l>
<l>The victor of his Daitya foes.</l>
<l>Raising his arms in anguish, he,</l>
<l>As when the woodman hews a tree</l>
<l>With its fair flowery branches crowned,</l>
<l>Fainted and fell upon the ground.</l>
<l>Lord of the earth to earth he sank,</l>
<l>Helpless, as when a towering bank</l>
<l>With sudden ruin buries deep</l>
<l>An elephant who lay asleep.</l>
<l>Then swift his wife and brothers flew,</l>
<l>And water, weeping, o'er him threw.</l>
<l>As slowly sense and strength he gained,</l>
<l>Fast from his eyes the tears he rained,</l>
<l>And then in accents sad and weak</l>
<l>Kakutstha's son began to speak,</l>
<l>And mourning for the monarch dead,</l>
<l>With righteous words to Bharat said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What calls me home, when he, alas,</q></l>
<l>Has gone the way which all must pass?</l>
<l>Of him, the best of kings bereft</l>
<l>What guardian has Ayodhyá left?</l>
<l>How may I please his spirit? how</l>
<l>Delight the high-souled monarch now,</l>
<l>Who wept for me and went above</l>
<l>By me ungraced with mourning love?</l>
<l>Ah, happy brothers! you have paid</l>
<l>Due offerings to his parting shade.</l>
<l>E'en when my banishment is o'er,</l>
<l>Back to my home I go no more,</l>
<l>To look upon the widowed state</l>
<l>Reft of her king, disconsolate.</l>
<l>E'en then, O tamer of the foe,</l>
<l>If to Ayodhyá's town I go,</l>
<l>Who will direct me as of old,</l>
<l>Now other worlds our father hold?</l>
<l>From whom, my brother, shall I hear</l>
<l>Those words which ever charmed mine ear</l>
<l>And filled my bosom with delight</l>
<l><q rend="post">Whene'er he saw me act aright?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma spoke: then nearer came</l>
<l>And looking on his moonbright dame,</l>
<l><q>Sítá, the king is gone,</q> he said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">And Lakshmaṇ, know thy sire is dead,</q></l>
<pb n="212"/><anchor id="Pg212"/>
<l>And with the Gods on high enrolled:</l>
<l><q rend="post">This mournful news has Bharat told.</q></l>
<l>He spoke: the noble youths with sighs</l>
<l>Rained down the torrents from their eyes.</l>
<l>And then the brothers of the chief</l>
<l>With words of comfort soothed his grief:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now to the king our sire who swayed</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The earth be due libations paid.</q></l>
<l>Soon as the monarch's fate she knew,</l>
<l>Sharp pangs of grief smote Sítá through:</l>
<l>Nor could she look upon her lord</l>
<l>With eyes from which the torrents poured.</l>
<l>And Ráma strove with tender care</l>
<l>To soothe the weeping dame's despair,</l>
<l>And then, with piercing woe distressed,</l>
<l>The mournful Lakshmaṇ thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Brother, I pray thee bring for me</q></l>
<l>The pressed fruit of the Ingudí,</l>
<l>And a bark mantle fresh and new,</l>
<l>That I may pay this offering due.</l>
<l>First of the three shall Sítá go,</l>
<l>Next thou, and I the last: for so</l>
<l><q rend="post">Moves the funereal pomp of woe.</q><note place="foot"><q>The order
of the procession on these occasions is that the children precede

<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Carey and Marshman.</hi></note></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sumantra of the noble mind,</l>
<l>Gentle and modest, meek and kind,</l>
<l>Who, follower of each princely youth,</l>
<l>To Ráma clung with constant truth,</l>
<l>Now with the royal brothers' aid</l>
<l>The grief of Ráma soothed and stayed,</l>
<l>And lent his arm his lord to guide</l>
<l>Down to the river's holy side.</l>
<l>That lovely stream the heroes found,</l>
<l>With woods that ever blossomed crowned,</l>
<l>And there in bitter sorrow bent</l>
<l>Their footsteps down the fair descent.</l>
<l>Then where the stream that swiftly flowed</l>
<l>A pure pellucid shallow showed,</l>
<l>The funeral drops they duly shed,</l>
<l>And <q>Father, this be thine,</q> they said.</l>
<l>But he, the lord who ruled the land,</l>
<l>Filled from the stream his hollowed hand,</l>
<l>And turning to the southern side</l>
<l>Stretched out his arm and weeping cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This sacred water clear and pure,</q></l>
<l>An offering which shall aye endure</l>
<l>To thee, O lord of kings, I give:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Accept it where the spirits live!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, when the solemn rite was o'er,</l>
<l>Came Ráma to the river shore,</l>
<l>And offered, with his brothers' aid,</l>
<l>Fresh tribute to his father's shade.</l>
<l>With jujube fruit he mixed the seed</l>
<l>Of Ingudís from moisture freed,</l>
<l>And placed it on a spot o'erspread</l>
<l>With sacred grass, and weeping said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Enjoy, great King, the cake which we</q></l>
<l>Thy children eat and offer thee!</l>
<l>For ne'er do blessed Gods refuse</l>
<l><q rend="post">To share the food which mortals use.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma turned him to retrace</l>
<l>The path that brought him to the place,</l>
<l>And up the mountain's pleasant side</l>
<l>Where lovely lawns lay fair, he hied.</l>
<l>Soon as his cottage door he gained</l>
<l>His brothers to his breast he strained.</l>
<l>From them and Sítá in their woes</l>
<l>So loud the cry of weeping rose,</l>
<l>That like the roar of lions round</l>
<l>The mountain rolled the echoing sound.</l>
<l>And Bharat's army shook with fear</l>
<l>The weeping of the chiefs to hear.</l>
<l><q>Bharat,</q> the soldiers cried, <q rend="pre">'tis plain,</q></l>
<l>His brother Ráma meets again,</l>
<l>And with these cries that round us ring</l>
<l><q rend="post">They sorrow for their sire the king.</q></l>
<l>Then leaving car and wain behind,</l>
<l>One eager thought in every mind,</l>
<l>Swift toward the weeping, every man,</l>
<l>As each could find a passage, ran.</l>
<l>Some thither bent their eager course</l>
<l>With car, and elephant, and horse,</l>
<l>And youthful captains on their feet</l>
<l>With longing sped their lord to meet,</l>
<l>As though the new-come prince had been</l>
<l>An exile for long years unseen.</l>
<l>Earth beaten in their frantic zeal</l>
<l>By clattering hoof and rumbling wheel,</l>
<l>Sent forth a deafening noise as loud</l>
<l>As heaven when black with many a cloud.</l>
<l>Then, with their consorts gathered near,</l>
<l>Wild elephants in sudden fear</l>
<l>Rushed to a distant wood, and shed</l>
<l>An odour round them as they fled.</l>
<l>And every silvan thing that dwelt</l>
<l>Within those shades the terror felt,</l>
<l>Deer, lion, tiger, boar and roe,</l>
<l>Bison, wild-cow, and buffalo.</l>
<l>And when the tumult wild they heard,</l>
<l>With trembling pinions flew each bird,</l>
<l>From tree, from thicket, and from lake,</l>
<l>Swan, koïl, curlew, crane, and drake.</l>
<l>With men the ground was overspread,</l>
<l>With startled birds the sky o'erhead.</l>
<l>Then on his sacrificial ground</l>
<l>The sinless, glorious chief was found.</l>
<l>Loading with curses deep and loud</l>
<l>The hump-back and the queen, the crowd</l>
<l>Whose cheeks were wet, whose eyes were dim,</l>
<l>In fond affection ran to him.</l>
<l>While the big tears their eyes bedewed,</l>
<l>He looked upon the multitude,</l>
<pb n="213"/><anchor id="Pg213"/>
<l>And then as sire and mother do,</l>
<l>His arms about his loved ones threw.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some to his feet with reverence pressed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Some in his arms he strained:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each friend, with kindly words addressed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Due share of honour gained.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, by their mighty woe o'ercome,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">The weeping heroes' cry</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Filled, like the roar of many a drum,</l>

<l>Vaśishṭha with his soul athirst</l>
<l>To look again on Ráma, first</l>
<l>In line the royal widows placed,</l>
<l>And then the way behind them traced.</l>
<l>The ladies moving, faint and slow,</l>
<l>Saw the fair stream before them flow,</l>
<l>And by the bank their steps were led</l>
<l>Which the two brothers visited.</l>
<l>Kauśalyá with her faded cheek</l>
<l>And weeping eyes began to speak,</l>
<l>And thus in mournful tones addressed</l>
<l>The queen Sumitrá and the rest:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">See in the wood the bank's descent,</q></l>
<l>Which the two orphan youths frequent,</l>
<l>Whose noble spirits never fall,</l>

<l>Draws water hence which mine requires.</l>
<l>This day, for lowly toil unfit,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As on the long-eyed lady strayed,</l>
<l>On holy grass, whose points were laid</l>
<l>Directed to the southern sky,</l>
<l>The funeral offering met her eye.</l>
<l>When Ráma's humble gift she spied</l>
<l>Thus to the queens Kauśalyá cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The gift of Ráma's hand behold,</q></l>
<l>His tribute to the king high-souled,</l>
<l>Offered to him, as texts require,</l>
<l>Lord of Ikshváku's line, his sire!</l>
<l>Not such I deem the funeral food</l>
<l>Of kings with godlike might endued.</l>
<l>Can he who knew all pleasures, he</l>
<l>Who ruled the earth from sea to sea,</l>
<l>The mighty lord of monarchs, feed</l>
<l>On Ingudí's extracted seed?</l>
<l>In all the world there cannot be</l>
<l>A woe, I ween, more sad to see,</l>
<l>Than that my glorious son should make</l>
<l>His funeral gift of such a cake.</l>
<l>The ancient text I oft have heard</l>
<l>This day is true in every word:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ne'er do the blessed Gods refuse</q></l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ladies soothed the weeping dame:</l>
<l>To Ráma's hermitage they came,</l>
<l>And there the hero met their eyes</l>
<l>Like a God fallen from the skies.</l>
<l>Him joyless, reft of all, they viewed,</l>
<l>And tears their mournful eyes bedewed.</l>
<l>The truthful hero left his seat,</l>
<l>And clasped the ladies' lotus feet,</l>
<l>And they with soft hands brushed away</l>
<l>The dust that on his shoulders lay.</l>
<l>Then Lakshmaṇ, when he saw each queen</l>
<l>With weeping eyes and troubled mien,</l>
<l>Near to the royal ladies drew</l>
<l>And paid them gentle reverence too.</l>
<l>He, Daśaratha's offspring, signed</l>
<l>The heir of bliss by Fortune kind,</l>
<l>Received from every dame no less</l>
<l>Each mark of love and tenderness.</l>
<l>And Sítá came and bent before</l>
<l>The widows, while her eyes ran o'er,</l>
<l>And pressed their feet with many a tear.</l>
<l>They when they saw the lady dear</l>
<l>Pale, worn with dwelling in the wild,</l>
<l>Embraced her as a darling child:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Daughter of royal Janak, bride</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Of Daśaratha's son,</q> they cried,</l>

<l>Endure this woe and suffering</l>

<l>Each sign of trouble on thy face—</l>
<l>That lotus which the sun has dried,</l>
<l>That lily by the tempest tried,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma, as she spoke distressed,</l>
<l>The feet of Saint Vaśishṭha pressed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Touched them with reverential love,</l>

<l>A while they sat, each lip compressed,</l>
<l>Then Bharat thus his chief addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My mother here was made content;</q></l>
<l>To me was given the government.</l>
<l>This now, my lord, I yield to thee:</l>
<l>Enjoy it, from all trouble free.</l>
<l>Like a great bridge the floods have rent,</l>
<l>Impetuous in their wild descent,</l>
<l>All other hands but thine in vain</l>
<l>Would strive the burthen to maintain.</l>
<l>In vain the ass with steeds would vie,</l>
<l>With Tárkshya,<note place="foot">Garuḍ, the king of birds.</note>
birds that wing the sky;</l>
<l>So, lord of men, my power is slight</l>
<l>To rival thine imperial might.</l>
<l>Great joys his happy days attend</l>
<l>On whom the hopes of men depend,</l>
<l>But wretched is the life he leads</l>
<l>Who still the aid of others needs.</l>
<l>And if the seed a man has sown,</l>
<l>With care and kindly nurture grown,</l>
<l>Rear its huge trunk and spring in time</l>
<l>Too bulky for a dwarf to climb,</l>
<l>Yet, with perpetual blossom gay,</l>
<l>No fruit upon its boughs display,</l>
<l>Ne'er can that tree, thus nursed in vain,</l>
<l>Approval of the virtuous gain.</l>
<l>The simile is meant to be</l>
<l>Applied, O mighty-armed, to thee,</l>
<l>Because, our lord and leader, thou</l>
<l>Protectest not thy people now.</l>
<l>O, be the longing wish fulfilled</l>
<l>Of every chief of house and guild,</l>
<l>To see again their sun-bright lord</l>
<l>Victorious to his realm restored!</l>
<l>As thou returnest through the crowd</l>
<l>Let roars of elephants be loud.</l>
<l>And each fair woman lift her voice</l>
<l><q rend="post">And in her new-found king rejoice.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The people all with longing moved,</l>
<l>The words that Bharat spoke approved,</l>
<l>And crowding near to Ráma pressed</l>
<l>The hero with the same request.</l>
<l>The steadfast Ráma, when he viewed</l>
<l>His glorious brother's mournful mood,</l>
<l>With each ambitious thought controlled,</l>
<l>Thus the lamenting prince consoled:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I cannot do the things I will,</q></l>
<l>For Ráma is but mortal still.</l>
<l>Fate with supreme, resistless law</l>
<l>This way and that its slave will draw,</l>
<l>All gathered heaps must waste away,</l>
<l>All lofty lore and powers decay.</l>
<l>Death is the end of life, and all,</l>
<l>Now firmly joined, apart must fall.</l>
<l>One fear the ripened fruit must know,</l>
<l>To fall upon the earth below;</l>
<l>So every man who draws his breath</l>
<l>Must fear inevitable death.</l>
<l>The pillared mansion, high, compact,</l>
<l>Must fall by Time's strong hand attacked;</l>
<l>So mortal men, the gradual prey</l>
<l>Of old and ruthless death, decay.</l>
<l>The night that flies no more returns:</l>
<l>Yamuná for the Ocean yearns:</l>
<l>Swift her impetuous waters flee,</l>
<l>But roll not backward from the sea.</l>
<l>The days and nights pass swiftly by</l>
<l>And steal our moments as they fly,</l>
<l>E'en as the sun's unpitying rays</l>
<l>Drink up the floods in summer blaze.</l>
<l>Then for thyself lament and leave</l>
<l>For death of other men to grieve,</l>
<l>For if thou go or if thou stay,</l>
<l>Thy life is shorter day by day.</l>
<l>Death travels with us; death attends</l>
<l>Our steps until our journey ends,</l>
<l>Death, when the traveller wins the goal,</l>
<l>Returns with the returning soul.</l>
<l>The flowing hair grows white and thin,</l>
<l>And wrinkles mark the altered skin.</l>
<l>The ills of age man's strength assail:</l>
<l>Ah, what can mortal power avail?</l>
<l>Men joy to see the sun arise,</l>
<l>They watch him set with joyful eyes:</l>
<l>But ne'er reflect, too blind to see,</l>
<l>How fast their own brief moments flee.</l>
<l>With lovely change for ever new</l>
<l>The seasons' sweet return they view,</l>
<l>Nor think with heedless hearts the while</l>
<l>That lives decay as seasons smile.</l>
<l>As haply on the boundless main</l>
<l>Meet drifting logs and part again,</l>
<l>So wives and children, friends and gold,</l>
<l>Ours for a little time we hold:</l>
<l>Soon by resistless laws of fate</l>
<l>To meet no more we separate.</l>
<l>In all this changing world not one</l>
<l>The common lot of all can shun:</l>
<l>Then why with useless tears deplore</l>
<l>The dead whom tears can bring no more?</l>
<l>As one might stand upon the way</l>
<l>And to a troop of travellers say:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">If ye allow it, sirs, I too</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Will travel on the road with you:</q></l>
<l>So why should mortal man lament</l>
<l>When on that path his feet are bent</l>
<l>Which all men living needs must tread,</l>
<l>Where sire and ancestors have led?</l>
<l>Life flies as torrents downward fall</l>
<l>Speeding away without recall,</l>
<l>So virtue should our thoughts engage,</l>
<l>For bliss<note place="foot">To be won by virtue.</note> is mortals' heritage.</l>

<l>To whom thy doubts are ever told.</l>
<l>Alike in death and life, to thee</l>
<l>The same to be and not to be.</l>
<l>The man who such a soul can gain</l>
<l>Can ne'er be crushed by woe or pain.</l>
<l>Pure as the Gods, high-minded, wise,</l>
<l>Concealed from thee no secret lies.</l>
<l>Such glorious gifts are all thine own,</l>
<l>And birth and death to thee are known,</l>
<l>That ill can ne'er thy soul depress</l>
<l>With all-subduing bitterness.</l>
<l>O let my prayer, dear brother, win</l>
<l>Thy pardon for my mother's sin.</l>
<l>Wrought for my sake who willed it not</l>
<l>When absent in a distant spot.</l>
<l>Duty alone with binding chains</l>
<l>The vengeance due to crime restrains,</l>
<l>Or on the sinner I should lift</l>
<l>My hand in retribution swift.</l>
<l>Can I who know the right, and spring</l>
<l>From Daśaratha, purest king—</l>
<l>Can I commit a heinous crime,</l>
<l>Abhorred by all through endless time?</l>
<l>The aged king I dare not blame,</l>
<l>Who died so rich in holy fame,</l>
<l>My honoured sire, my parted lord,</l>
<l>E'en as a present God adored.</l>
<l>Yet who in lore of duty skilled</l>
<l>So foul a crime has ever willed,</l>
<l>And dared defy both gain and right</l>
<l>To gratify a woman's spite?</l>
<l>When death draws near, so people say,</l>
<l>The sense of creatures dies away;</l>
<l>And he has proved the ancient saw</l>
<l>By acting thus in spite of law.</l>
<l>But O my honoured lord, be kind,</l>
<l>Dismiss the trespass from thy mind,</l>
<l>The sin the king committed, led</l>
<l>By haste, his consort's wrath, and dread.</l>
<l>For he who veils his sire's offence</l>
<l>With tender care and reverence—</l>
<l>His sons approved by all shall live:</l>
<l>Not so their fate who ne'er forgive.</l>
<l>Be thou, my lord, the noble son,</l>
<l>And the vile deed my sire has done,</l>
<l>Abhorred by all the virtuous, ne'er</l>
<l>Resent, lest thou the guilt too share.</l>
<l>Preserve us, for on thee we call,</l>
<l>Our sire, Kaikeyí, me and all</l>
<l>Thy citizens, thy kith and kin;</l>
<l>Preserve us and reverse the sin.</l>
<l>To live in woods a devotee</l>
<l>Can scarce with royal tasks agree,</l>
<l>Nor can the hermit's matted hair</l>
<l>Suit fitly with a ruler's care.</l>
<l>Do not, my brother, do not still</l>
<l>Pursue this life that suits thee ill.</l>
<l>Mid duties of a king we count</l>
<l>His consecration paramount,</l>
<l>That he with ready heart and hand</l>
<l>May keep his people and his land.</l>
<l>What Warrior born to royal sway</l>
<l>From certain good would turn away,</l>
<l>A doubtful duty to pursue,</l>
<l>That mocks him with the distant view?</l>
<l>Thou wouldst to duty cleave, and gain</l>
<l>The meed that follows toil and pain.</l>
<l>In thy great task no labour spare:</l>
<l>Rule the four castes with justest care.</l>
<l>Mid all the four, the wise prefer</l>
<l>The order of the householder:<note place="foot">The four religious orders, referable
to different times of life are, that of the student, that of the householder, that of
the anchorite, and that of the mendicant.</note></l>
<pb n="216"/><anchor id="Pg216"/>
<l>Canst thou, whose thoughts to duty cleave,</l>
<l>The best of all the orders leave?</l>
<l>My better thou in lore divine,</l>
<l>My birth, my sense must yield to thine:</l>
<l>While thou, my lord, art here to reign,</l>
<l>How shall my hands the rule maintain?</l>
<l>O faithful lover of the right,</l>
<l>Take with thy friends the royal might,</l>
<l>Let thy sires' realm, from trouble free,</l>
<l>Obey her rightful king in thee.</l>
<l>Here let the priests and lords of state</l>
<l>Our monarch duly consecrate,</l>
<l>With prayer and holy verses blessed</l>
<l>By saint Vaśishṭha and the rest.</l>
<l>Anointed king by us, again</l>
<l>Seek fair Ayodhyá, there to reign,</l>
<l>And like imperial Indra girt</l>
<l>By Gods of Storm, thy might assert.</l>
<l>From the three debts<note place="foot">To Gods, men, and Manes.</note>
acquittance earn,</l>
<l>And with thy wrath the wicked burn,</l>
<l>O'er all of us thy rule extend,</l>
<l>And cheer with boons each faithful friend.</l>
<l>Let thine enthronement, lord, this day</l>
<l>Make all thy lovers glad and gay,</l>
<l>And let all those who hate thee flee</l>
<l>To the ten winds for fear of thee.</l>
<l>Dear lord, my mother's words of hate</l>
<l>With thy sweet virtues expiate,</l>
<l>And from the stain of folly clear</l>
<l>The father whom we both revere.</l>
<l>Brother, to me compassion show,</l>
<l>I pray thee with my head bent low,</l>
<l>And to these friends who on thee call,—</l>
<l>As the Great Father pities all.</l>
<l>But if my tears and prayers be vain,</l>

<lg>
<l>Thus, by his friends encompassed round,</l>
<l>He spoke, and Ráma, far renowned,</l>
<l>To his dear brother thus replied,</l>
<l>Whom holy rites had purified:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O thou whom Queen Kaikeyí bare</q></l>
<l>The best of kings, thy words are fair,</l>
<l>Our royal father, when of yore</l>
<l>He wed her, to her father swore</l>
<l>The best of kingdoms to confer,</l>
<l>A noble dowry meet for her;</l>
<l>Then, grateful, on the deadly day</l>
<l>Of heavenly Gods' and demons' fray,</l>
<l>A future boon on her bestowed</l>
<l>To whose sweet care his life he owed.</l>
<l>She to his mind that promise brought,</l>
<l>And then the best of kings besought</l>
<l>To bid me to the forest flee,</l>
<l>And give the rule, O Prince, to thee.</l>
<l>Thus bound by oath, the king our lord</l>
<l>Gave her those boons of free accord,</l>
<l>And bade me, O thou chief of men,</l>
<l>Live in the woods four years and ten.</l>
<l>I to this lonely wood have hied</l>
<l>With faithful Lakshmaṇ by my side,</l>
<l>And Sítá by no tears deterred,</l>
<l>Resolved to keep my father's word.</l>
<l>And thou, my noble brother, too</l>
<l>Shouldst keep our father's promise true:</l>
<l>Anointed ruler of the state</l>
<l>Maintain his word inviolate.</l>
<l>From his great debt, dear brother, free</l>

<l>Then, best of men, our sire release</l>

<head>Canto CVIII. Jáváli's Speech.</head>

<lg>
<l>Thus Ráma soothed his brother's grief:</l>
<l>Then virtuous Jáváli, chief</l>
<l>Of twice-born sages, thus replied</l>
<l>In words that virtue's law defied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Hail, Raghu's princely son, dismiss</q></l>
<l>A thought so weak and vain as this.</l>
<l>Canst thou, with lofty heart endowed,</l>
<l>Think with the dull ignoble crowd?</l>
<l>For what are ties of kindred? can</l>
<l>One profit by a brother man?</l>
<l>Alone the babe first opes his eyes,</l>
<l>And all alone at last he dies.</l>
<l>The man, I ween, has little sense</l>
<l>Who looks with foolish reverence</l>
<l>On father's or on mother's name:</l>
<l>In others, none a right may claim.</l>
<l>E'en as a man may leave his home</l>
<l>And to a distant village roam,</l>
<l>Then from his lodging turn away</l>
<l>And journey on the following day,</l>
<l>Such brief possession mortals hold</l>
<l>In sire and mother, house and gold,</l>
<l>And never will the good and wise</l>
<l>The brief uncertain lodging prize.</l>
<l>Nor, best of men, shouldst thou disown</l>
<l>Thy sire's hereditary throne,</l>
<l>And tread the rough and stony ground</l>
<l>Where hardship, danger, woes abound.</l>
<l>Come, let Ayodhyá rich and bright</l>
<l>See thee enthroned with every rite:</l>
<l>Her tresses bound in single braid<note place="foot"><p>It was the custom of Indian
women when mourning for their absent husbands to bind their hair in a long single
braid.</p>
<p>Carey and Marshman translate, <q>the one-tailed city.</q></p></note></l>
<l>She waits thy coming long delayed.</l>
<l>O come, thou royal Prince, and share</l>
<l>The kingly joys that wait thee there,</l>
<l>And live in bliss transcending price</l>
<l>As Indra lives in Paradise.</l>
<l>The parted king is naught to thee,</l>
<l>Nor right in living man has he:</l>
<l>The king is one, thou, Prince of men,</l>
<l>Another art: be counselled then.</l>
<l>Thy royal sire, O chief, has sped</l>
<l>On the long path we all must tread.</l>
<l>The common lot of all is this,</l>
<l>And thou in vain art robbed of bliss.</l>
<l>For those—and only those—I weep</l>
<l>Who to the path of duty keep;</l>
<l>For here they suffer ceaseless woe,</l>
<l>And dying to destruction go.</l>
<l>With pious care, each solemn day,</l>
<l>Will men their funeral offerings pay:</l>
<l>See, how the useful food they waste:</l>
<l>He who is dead no more can taste.</l>
<l>If one is fed, his strength renewed</l>
<l>Whene'er his brother takes his food,</l>
<l>Then offerings to the parted pay:</l>
<l>Scarce will they serve him on his way.</l>
<l>By crafty knaves these rules were framed,</l>
<l>And to enforce men's gifts proclaimed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Give, worship, lead a life austere,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Keep lustral rites, quit pleasures here.</q></l>
<l>There is no future life: be wise,</l>
<l>And do, O Prince, as I advise.</l>
<l>Enjoy, my lord, the present bliss,</l>
<l>And things unseen from thought dismiss.</l>
<l>Let this advice thy bosom move,</l>

<head>Canto CIX. The Praises Of Truth.</head>

<lg>
<l>By sage Jáváli thus addressed,</l>
<l>Ráma of truthful hearts the best,</l>
<pb n="218"/><anchor id="Pg218"/>
<l>With perfect skill and wisdom high</l>
<l>Thus to his speech made fit reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thy words that tempt to bliss are fair,</q></l>
<l>But virtue's garb they falsely wear.</l>
<l>For he from duty's path who strays</l>
<l>To wander in forbidden ways,</l>
<l>Allured by doctrine false and vain,</l>
<l>Praise from the good can never gain.</l>
<l>Their lives the true and boaster show,</l>
<l>Pure and impure, and high and low,</l>
<l>Else were no mark to judge between</l>
<l>Stainless and stained and high and mean;</l>
<l>They to whose lot fair signs may fall</l>
<l>Were but as they who lack them all,</l>
<l>And those to virtuous thoughts inclined</l>
<l>Were but as men of evil mind.</l>
<l>If in the sacred name of right</l>
<l>I do this wrong in duty's spite;</l>
<l>The path of virtue meanly quit,</l>
<l>And this polluting sin commit,</l>
<l>What man who marks the bounds between</l>
<l>Virtue and vice with insight keen,</l>
<l>Would rank me high in after time</l>
<l>Stained with this soul destroying crime?</l>
<l>Whither could I, the sinner, turn,</l>
<l>How hope a seat in heaven to earn,</l>
<l>If I my plighted promise break,</l>
<l>And thus the righteous path forsake?</l>
<l>This world of ours is ever led</l>
<l>To walk the ways which others tread,</l>
<l>And as their princes they behold,</l>
<l>The subjects too their lives will mould.</l>
<l>That truth and mercy still must be</l>
<l>Beloved of kings, is Heaven's decree.</l>
<l>Upheld by truth the monarch reigns,</l>
<l>And truth the very world sustains.</l>
<l>Truth evermore has been the love</l>
<l>Of holy saints and Gods above,</l>
<l>And he whose lips are truthful here</l>
<l>Wins after death the highest sphere.</l>
<l>As from a serpent's deadly tooth,</l>
<l>We shrink from him who scorns the truth.</l>
<l>For holy truth is root and spring</l>
<l>Of justice and each holy thing,</l>
<l>A might that every power transcends,</l>
<l>Linked to high bliss that never ends.</l>
<l>Truth is all virtue's surest base,</l>
<l>Supreme in worth and first in place.</l>
<l>Oblations, gifts men offer here,</l>
<l>Vows, sacrifice, and rites austere,</l>
<l>And Holy Writ, on truth depend:</l>
<l>So men must still that truth defend.</l>
<l>Truth, only truth protects the land,</l>
<l>By truth unharmed our houses stand;</l>
<l>Neglect of truth makes men distressed,</l>
<l>And truth in highest heaven is blessed.</l>
<l>Then how can I, rebellious, break</l>
<l>Commandments which my father spake—</l>
<l>I ever true and faithful found,</l>
<l>And by my word of honour bound?</l>
<l>My father's bridge of truth shall stand</l>
<l>Unharmed by my destructive hand:</l>
<l>Not folly, ignorance, or greed</l>
<l>My darkened soul shall thus mislead.</l>
<l>Have we not heard that God and shade</l>
<l>Turn from the hated offerings paid</l>
<l>By him whose false and fickle mind</l>
<l>No pledge can hold, no promise bind?</l>
<l>Truth is all duty: as the soul,</l>
<l>It quickens and supports the whole.</l>
<l>The good respect this duty: hence</l>
<l>Its sacred claims I reverence.</l>
<l>The Warrior's duty I despise</l>
<l>That seeks the wrong in virtue's guise:</l>
<l>Those claims I shrink from, which the base,</l>
<l>Cruel, and covetous embrace.</l>
<l>The heart conceives the guilty thought,</l>
<l>Then by the hand the sin is wrought,</l>
<l>And with the pair is leagued a third,</l>
<l>The tongue that speaks the lying word.</l>
<l>Fortune and land and name and fame</l>
<l>To man's best care have right and claim;</l>
<l>The good will aye to truth adhere,</l>
<l>And its high laws must men revere.</l>
<l>Base were the deed thy lips would teach,</l>
<l>Approved as best by subtle speech.</l>
<l>Shall I my plighted promise break,</l>
<l>That I these woods my home would make?</l>
<l>Shall I, as Bharat's words advise,</l>
<l>My father's solemn charge despise?</l>
<l>Firm stands the oath which then before</l>
<l>My father's face I soothly swore,</l>
<l>Which Queen Kaikeyí's anxious ear</l>
<l>Rejoiced with highest joy to hear.</l>
<l>Still in the wood will I remain,</l>
<l>With food prescribed my life sustain,</l>
<l>And please with fruit and roots and flowers</l>
<l>Ancestral shades and heavenly powers.</l>
<l>Here every sense contented, still</l>
<l>Heeding the bounds of good and ill,</l>
<l>My settled course will I pursue,</l>
<l>Firm in my faith and ever true.</l>
<l>Here in this wild and far retreat</l>
<l>Will I my noble task complete;</l>
<l>And Fire and Wind and Moon shall be</l>
<l>Partakers of its fruit with me.</l>
<l>A hundred offerings duly wrought</l>
<l>His rank o'er Gods for Indra bought,</l>

<l>Then spake Vaśishṭha who perceived</l>
<l>That Ráma's soul was wroth and grieved:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Well knows the sage Jáváli all</q></l>
<l>The changes that the world befall;</l>
<l>And but to lead thee to revoke</l>
<l>Thy purpose were the words he spoke.</l>
<l>Lord of the world, now hear from me</l>
<l>How first this world began to be.</l>
<l>First water was, and naught beside;</l>
<l>There earth was formed that stretches wide.</l>
<l>Then with the Gods from out the same</l>
<l>The Self-existent Brahmá came.</l>
<l>Then Brahmá<note place="foot">In Gorresio's recension identified with
Vishṇu. See Muir's <hi rend='italic'>Sanskrit Texts, Vol.

<l>Bade from the deep this earth arise;</l>
<l>Then, with his sons of tranquil soul,</l>
<l>He made the world and framed the whole.</l>
<l>From subtlest ether Brahmá rose:</l>
<l>No end, no loss, no change he knows.</l>
<l>A son had he, Maríchi styled,</l>
<l>And Kaśyap was Maríchi's child.</l>
<l>From him Vivasvat sprang: from him</l>
<l>Manu, whose fame shall ne'er be dim.</l>
<l>Manu, who life to mortals gave,</l>
<l>Begot Ikshváku good and brave:</l>
<l>First of Ayodhyá's kings was he,</l>
<l>Pride of her famous dynasty.</l>
<l>From him the glorious Kukshi sprang,</l>
<l>Whose fame through all the regions rang.</l>
<l>Rival of Kukshi's ancient fame,</l>
<l>His heir the great Vikukshi came.</l>
<l>His son was Váṇa, lord of might,</l>
<l>His Anaraṇya, strong in fight.</l>
<l>No famine marred his blissful reign,</l>
<l>No drought destroyed the kindly grain;</l>
<l>Amid the sons of virtue chief,</l>
<l>His happy realm ne'er held a thief,</l>
<l>His son was Prithu, glorious name,</l>
<l>From him the wise Triśanku came:</l>
<l>Embodied to the skies he went</l>
<l>For love of truth preëminent.</l>
<l>He left a son renowned afar,</l>
<l>Known by the name of Dhundhumár.</l>
<l>His son succeeding bore the name</l>
<l>Of Yuvanáśva dear to fame.</l>
<l>He passed away. Him followed then</l>
<l>His son Mándhátá, king of men.</l>
<l>His son was blest in high emprise,</l>
<l>Susandhi, fortunate and wise.</l>
<l>Two noble sons had he, to wit</l>
<l>Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit.</l>
<l>Bharat was Dhruvasandhi's son:</l>
<l>His glorious arm the conquest won,</l>
<l>Against his son King Asit, rose</l>
<l>In fierce array his royal foes,</l>
<l>Haihayas, Tálajanghas styled,</l>
<l>And Śaśivindhus fierce and wild.</l>
<pb n="220"/><anchor id="Pg220"/>
<l>Long time he strove, but forced to yield</l>
<l>Fled from his kingdom and the field.</l>
<l>The wives he left had both conceived—</l>
<l>So is the ancient tale believed:—</l>
<l>One, of her rival's hopes afraid,</l>
<l>Fell poison in the viands laid.</l>
<l>It chanced that Chyavan, Bhrigu's child,</l>
<l>Had wandered to the pathless wild</l>
<l>Where proud Himálaya's lovely height</l>
<l>Detained him with a strange delight.</l>
<l>Then came the other widowed queen</l>
<l>With lotus eyes and beauteous mien,</l>
<l>Longing a noble son to bear,</l>
<l>And wooed the saint with earnest prayer.</l>
<l>When thus Kálindí, fairest dame</l>
<l>With reverent supplication came,</l>
<l>To her the holy sage replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O royal lady, from thy side</q></l>
<l>A glorious son shall spring ere long,</l>
<l>Righteous and true and brave and strong;</l>
<l>He, scourge of foes and lofty-souled,</l>
<l><q rend="post">His ancient race shall still uphold.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then round the sage the lady went,</l>
<l>And bade farewell, most reverent.</l>
<l>Back to her home she turned once more,</l>
<l>And there her promised son she bore.</l>
<l>Because her rival mixed the bane</l>
<l>To render her conception vain,</l>
<l>And her unripened fruit destroy,</l>
<l>Sagar she called her rescued boy.<note place="foot">From <hi rend='italic'>sa</hi>

<l>Filled living creatures with affright:</l>
<l>Obedient to his high decree</l>
<l>His countless sons dug out the sea.</l>
<l>Prince Asamanj was Sagar's child:</l>
<l>But him with cruel sin defiled</l>
<l>And loaded with the people's hate</l>
<l>His father banished from the state.</l>
<l>To Asamanj his consort bare</l>
<l>Bright Anśumán his valiant heir.</l>
<l>Anśumán's son, Dilípa famed,</l>
<l>Begot a son Bhagírath named.</l>
<l>From him renowned Kakutstha came:</l>
<l>Thou bearest still the lineal name.</l>
<l>Kakutstha's son was Raghu: thou</l>
<l>Art styled the son of Raghu now.</l>
<l>From him came Purushádak bold,</l>
<l>Fierce hero of gigantic mould:</l>
<l>Kalmáshapáda's name he bore,</l>
<l>Because his feet were spotted o'er.</l>
<l>Śankhan his son, to manhood grown,</l>
<l>Died sadly with his host o'erthrown,</l>
<l>But ere he perished sprang from him</l>
<l>Sudarśan fair in face and limb.</l>
<l>From beautiful Sudarśan came</l>
<l>Prince Agnivarṇa, bright as flame.</l>
<l>His son was Śíghraga, for speed</l>
<l>Unmatched; and Maru was his seed.</l>
<l>Prasusruka was Maru's child:</l>
<l>His son was Ambarísha styled.</l>
<l>Nahush was Ambarísha's heir</l>
<l>With hand to strike and heart to dare.</l>
<l>His son was good Nábhág, from youth</l>
<l>Renowned for piety and truth.</l>
<l>From great Nábhág sprang children two</l>

<head>Canto CXI. Counsel To Bharat.</head>

<lg>
<l>Thus said Vaśishṭha, and again</l>
<l>To Ráma spake in duteous strain:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">All men the light of life who see</q></l>
<l>With high respect should look on three:</l>
<l>High honour ne'er must be denied</l>
<l>To father, mother, holy guide.</l>
<l>First to their sires their birth they owe,</l>
<l>Nursed with maternal love they grow:</l>
<l>Their holy guides fair knowledge teach:</l>
<l>So men should love and honour each.</l>
<l>Thy sire and thou have learned of me,</l>
<l>The sacred guide of him and thee,</l>
<l>And if my word thou wilt obey</l>
<l>Thou still wilt keep the virtuous way.</l>
<l>See, with the chiefs of every guild</l>
<l>And all thy friends, this place is filled:</l>
<l>All these, as duty bids, protect;</l>
<l>So still the righteous path respect.</l>
<l>O, for thine aged mother feel,</l>
<l>Nor spurn the virtuous dame's appeal:</l>
<l>Obey, O Prince, thy mother dear,</l>
<l>And still to virtue's path adhere.</l>
<l>Yield thou to Bharat's fond request,</l>
<l>With earnest supplication pressed,</l>
<l>So wilt thou to thyself be true,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And faith and duty still pursue.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by his saintly guide addressed</l>
<l>With pleas in sweetest tones expressed,</l>
<l>The lord of men in turn replied</l>
<l>To wise Vaśishṭha by his side:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The fondest son's observance ne'er</q></l>
<l>Repays the sire and mother's care:</l>
<pb n="221"/><anchor id="Pg221"/>
<l>The constant love that food provides,</l>
<l>And dress, and every need besides:</l>
<l>Their pleasant words still soft and mild,</l>
<l>Their nurture of the helpless child:</l>
<l>The words which Daśaratha spake,</l>
<l><q rend="post">My king and sire, I ne'er will break.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Bharat of the ample chest</l>
<l>The wise Sumantra thus addressed;</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Bring sacred grass, O charioteer,</q></l>
<l>And strew it on the level here.</l>
<l>For I will sit and watch his face</l>
<l>Until I win my brother's grace.</l>
<l>Like a robbed Bráhman will I lie,<note place="foot">A practice which has frequently
been described, under the name of <hi rend='italic'>dherna</hi>, by
European travellers in India.</note></l>
<l>Nor taste of food nor turn my eye,</l>
<l>In front of Ráma's leafy cot,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And till he yield will leave him not.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Bharat saw Sumantra's eye</l>
<l>Looked up to Ráma for reply,</l>
<l>The Prince himself in eager haste</l>
<l>The sacred grass in order placed.</l>
<l>Him great and mighty Ráma, best</l>
<l>Of royal saints, in turn addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What, Bharat, have I done, that thou</q></l>
<l>Besiegest me,<note place="foot">Compare Milton's <q><hi rend='italic'>beseeching
or beseiging</hi>.</q></note> a suppliant now?</l>
<l>Thus streched, to force redress for wrongs</l>
<l>To men of Bráhman birth belongs,</l>
<l>Not those upon whose kingly head</l>
<l>The consecrating drops are shed.</l>
<l>Up, lord of men! arise, and quit</l>
<l>This fearful vow for thee unfit.</l>
<l>Go, brother, seek Ayodhyá's town,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Fair city of supreme renown.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Bharat, as his seat he took,</l>
<l>Cast all around an eager look:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O people, join your prayers with mine,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">And so his stubborn heart incline.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the people answered thus:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Full well is Ráma known to us.</q></l>
<l>Right is the word he speaks and he</l>
<l>Is faithful to his sire's decree:</l>
<l>Nor can we rashly venture now</l>
<l><q rend="post">To turn him from his purposed vow.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma spoke: <q rend="pre">O Bharat, heed</q></l>
<l>Thy virtuous friends, and mark their rede.</l>
<l>Mark well what I and these advise,</l>
<l>And duty view with clearer eyes.</l>
<l>Thy hand on mine, O hero, place,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Touch water, and thy sin efface.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Bharat rose: his hand he dipped,</l>
<l>And purifying water sipped:</l>
<l><q>Each citizen,</q> he cried, <q rend="pre">give ear,</q></l>
<l>Attend, each counsellor and peer.</l>
<l>My mother planned, by me untaught,</l>
<l>To win the sway I never sought:</l>
<l>Ne'er Raghu's son could I despise,</l>
<l>In duty's lore supremely wise.</l>
<l>Now if obedience to our sire</l>
<l>This dwelling in the woods require,</l>
<l>I, till the destined years be spent,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Will dwell alone in banishment.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The virtuous Ráma, wonder-stirred,</l>
<l>The faithful speech of Bharat heard,</l>
<l>And thus the hero's feelings found</l>
<l>Due utterance, as he gazed around:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Still to my father's word I hold,</q></l>
<l>Whate'er he bought, or pledged, or sold:</l>
<l>Ne'er shall his living promise be</l>
<l>Annulled by Bharat or by me.</l>
<l>Not thus my task will I evade,</l>
<l>My exile on another laid:</l>
<l>Most wise was Queen Kaikeyí's rede,</l>
<l>And just and good my father's deed.</l>
<l>Dear Bharat's patient soul I know,</l>
<l>How reverence due he loves to show;</l>
<l>In him, high-souled and faithful found,</l>
<l>Must each auspicious grace abound.</l>
<l>When from the woods I turn again</l>
<l>I with his aid shall nobly reign,</l>
<l>With one so good, of peerless worth,</l>
<l>A glorious lord of happy earth.</l>
<l>Her boon Kaikeyí sought and won.</l>
<l>I, as my father swore, have done:</l>
<l>And O, do thou, my brother dear,</l>
<l>The monarch's name from falsehood clear.</l>

<lg>
<l>High wonder mingled with delight</l>
<l>Took the great sages at the sight,</l>
<l>Thrilling their breasts who came to view</l>
<l>The meeting of the peerless two.</l>
<l>The saints and sages' holy train</l>
<l>Departed to their home again.</l>
<l>And high each holy voice was raised,</l>
<l>And thus the glorious brothers praised.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">High fate is his, the sire of two</q></l>
<l>Most virtuous souls, so brave and true:</l>
<l>With wonder and with joy intense</l>
<l><q rend="post">Our ears have heard their conference.</q></l>
<l>Then the great sages, longing all</l>

<l>To Bharat, bravest of the brave,</l>
<l>Their salutary counsel gave:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">O thou of lofty lineage born,</q></l>
<l>Whom wisdom, conduct, fame adorn,</l>
<l>Thou for thy honoured father's sake</l>
<l>Shouldst Ráma's righteous counsel take.</l>
<pb n="222"/><anchor id="Pg222"/>
<l>All debts to Queen Kaikeyí paid,</l>
<l>Thy sire his home in heaven has made,</l>
<l>So virtuous Ráma we would see</l>
<l><q rend="post">From filial obligation free.</q></l>
<l>Thus gave each royal sage advice,</l>
<l>High saint, and bard of Paradise;</l>
<l>Then quickly vanishing from view</l>
<l>Each to his proper home withdrew.</l>
<l>Then Ráma's face his rapture showed,</l>
<l>And his full heart with joy o'erflowed,</l>
<l>While, as the sages parted thence,</l>
<l>He paid his humble reverence.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Bharat shook in every limb</l>
<l>As suppliant thus he spake to him:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The duty of a king respect,</q></l>
<l>Held by our race in high respect:</l>
<l>And O, thy gracious ear incline</l>
<l>To heed my mother's prayer and mine.</l>
<l>The mighty realm to rule and guard</l>
<l>For me alone is task too hard.</l>
<l>No power have I the love to gain</l>
<l>Of noble, citizen, and swain.</l>
<l>All those who know thee, warrior, friend,</l>
<l>On thee their eager glances bend,</l>
<l>As labouring hinds who till the plain</l>
<l>Look fondly for the Lord of Rain.</l>
<l>O wisest Prince, thy realm secure,</l>
<l>And make its firm foundations sure.</l>
<l>Kakutstha's son, thy mighty arm</l>
<l><q rend="post">Can keep the nation free from harm.</q></l>
<l>He spoke, and fell in sorrow drowned</l>
<l>At Ráma's feet upon the ground,</l>
<l>And there the hero sued and sighed,</l>
<l>And <q>Hear me, Raghu's son,</q> he cried.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma raised him up, and pressed</l>
<l>His brother to his loving breast,</l>
<l>And sweetly as a wild swan cried</l>
<l>To Bharat dark and lotus-eyed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">So just and true thy generous soul,</q></l>
<l>Thy hand may well this earth control:</l>
<l>But many a sage his aid will lend,</l>
<l>With counsellor, and peer, and friend:</l>
<l>With these advise: their counsel ask,</l>
<l>And so perform thy arduous task.</l>
<l>The moon his beauty may forgo,</l>
<l>The cold forsake the Hills of Snow,</l>
<l>And Ocean o'er his banks may sweep,</l>
<l>But I my father's word will keep.</l>
<l>Now whether love of thee or greed</l>
<l>Thy mother led to plan the deed,</l>
<l>Forth from thy breast the memory throw,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And filial love and reverence show.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake Kauśalyá's son: again</l>
<l>Bharat replied in humble strain</l>
<l>To him who matched the sun in might</l>
<l>And lovely as the young moon's light:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Put, noble brother, I entreat,</q></l>
<l>These sandals on thy blessed feet:</l>
<l>These, lord of men, with gold bedecked,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The realm and people will protect.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma, as his brother prayed</l>
<l>Beneath his feet the sandals laid,</l>
<l>And these with fond affection gave</l>
<l>To Bharat's hand, the good and brave.</l>
<l>Then Bharat bowed his reverent head</l>
<l>And thus again to Ráma said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Through fourteen seasons will I wear</q></l>
<l>The hermit's dress and matted hair:</l>
<l>With fruit and roots my life sustain,</l>
<l>And still beyond the realm remain,</l>
<l>Longing for thee to come again.</l>
<l>The rule and all affairs of state</l>
<l>I to these shoes will delegate.</l>
<l>And if, O tamer of thy foes,</l>
<l>When fourteen years have reached their close,</l>
<l>I see thee not that day return,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The kindled fire my frame shall burn.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma to his bosom drew</l>
<l>Dear Bharat and Śatrughna too:</l>
<l><q>Be never wroth,</q> he cried, <q rend="pre">with her,</q></l>
<l>Kaikeyí's guardian minister:</l>
<l>This, glory of Ikshváku's line,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Is Sítá's earnest prayer and mine.</q></l>
<l>He spoke, and as the big tears fell,</l>
<l>To his dear brother bade farewell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Round Ráma, Bharat strong and bold</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">In humble reverence paced,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the bright sandals wrought with gold</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Above his brows were placed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The royal elephant who led</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">The glorious pomp he found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on the monster's mighty head</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Those sandals duly bound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then noble Ráma, born to swell</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">The glories of his race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To all in order bade farewell</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">With love and tender grace—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To brothers, counsellers, and peers,—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Still firm, in duty proved,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">No queen, for choking sobs and sighs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Could say her last adieu:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma bowed, with flooded eyes,</l>

<l>Then from that lovely river they</l>

<l>With reverent steps from left to right</l>
<l>They circled Chitrakúṭa's height,</l>
<l>And viewed his peaks on every side</l>
<l>With stains of thousand metals dyed.</l>

<l>And when the chieftain bold and sage</l>
<l>Had reached that holy hermitage,</l>
<l>Down from the car he sprang to greet</l>
<l>The saint, and bowed before his feet.</l>
<l>High rapture filled the hermit's breast,</l>
<l>Who thus the royal prince addressed:</l>

<l><q rend="post">Hast thou with Ráma met, my son?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief whose soul to virtue clave</l>
<l>This answer to the hermit gave:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I prayed him with our holy guide:</q></l>
<l>But Raghu's son our prayer denied,</l>
<l>And long besought by both of us</l>
<l>He answered Saint Vaśishṭha thus:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">True to my vow, I still will be</q></l>
<l>Observant of my sire's decree:</l>
<l>Till fourteen years complete their course</l>
<l><q rend="post">That promise shall remain in force.</q></l>
<l>The saint in highest wisdom taught,</l>

<l><q rend="post">Our welfare, and our bliss secure.</q></l>
<l>When Ráma heard the royal priest</l>
<l>He rose, and looking to the east</l>
<l>Consigned the sandals to my hand</l>
<l>That they for him might guard the land.</l>
<l>Then from the high-souled chief's abode</l>
<l>I turned upon my homeward road,</l>

<head>Canto CXVI. The Hermit's Speech.</head>

<lg>
<l>When Bharat took his homeward road</l>
<l>Still Ráma in the wood abode:</l>
<l>But soon he marked the fear and care</l>
<l>That darkened all the hermits there.</l>
<l>For all who dwelt before the hill</l>
<l>Were sad with dread of coming ill:</l>
<l>Each holy brow was lined by thought,</l>
<l>And Ráma's side they often sought.</l>
<l>With gathering frowns the prince they eyed,</l>
<l>And then withdrew and talked aside.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Raghu's son with anxious breast</l>
<l>The leader of the saints addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Can aught that I have done displease,</q></l>
<l>O reverend Sage, the devotees?</l>
<l>Why are their loving looks, O say,</l>
<l>Thus sadly changed or turned away?</l>
<l>Has Lakshmaṇ through his want of heed</l>
<l>Offended with unseemly deed?</l>
<l>Or is the gentle Sítá, she</l>
<l>Who loved to honour you and me—</l>
<l>Is she the cause of this offence,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Failing in lowly reverence?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One sage, o'er whom, exceeding old,</l>
<l>Had many a year of penance rolled,</l>
<l>Trembling in every aged limb</l>
<l>Thus for the rest replied to him:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">How could we, O beloved, blame</q></l>
<l>Thy lofty-souled Videhan dame,</l>
<l>Who in the good of all delights,</l>
<l>And more than all of anchorites?</l>
<l>But yet through thee a numbing dread</l>
<l>Of fiends among our band has spread;</l>
<l>Obstructed by the demons' art</l>
<l>The trembling hermits talk apart.</l>
<l>For Rávaṇ's brother, overbold,</l>
<l>Named Khara, of gigantic mould,</l>
<l>Vexes with fury fierce and fell</l>
<l>All those in Janasthán<note place="foot">A part of the great Daṇḍak forest.</note>
who dwell.</l>
<l>Resistless in his cruel deeds,</l>
<l>On flesh of men the monster feeds:</l>
<l>Sinful and arrogant is he,</l>
<l>And looks with special hate on thee.</l>
<l>Since thou, beloved son, hast made</l>
<l>Thy home within this holy shade,</l>
<l>The fiends have vexed with wilder rage</l>
<l>The dwellers of the hermitage.</l>
<l>In many a wild and dreadful form</l>
<l>Around the trembling saints they swarm,</l>
<l>With hideous shape and foul disguise</l>
<l>They terrify our holy eyes.</l>
<l>They make our loathing souls endure</l>
<l>Insult and scorn and sights impure,</l>
<l>And flocking round the altars stay</l>
<l>The holy rites we love to pay.</l>
<l>In every spot throughout the grove</l>
<l>With evil thoughts the monsters rove,</l>
<l>Assailing with their secret might</l>
<l>Each unsuspecting anchorite.</l>
<l>Ladle and dish away they fling,</l>
<l>Our fires with floods extinguishing,</l>
<l>And when the sacred flame should burn</l>
<l>They trample on each water-urn.</l>
<l>Now when they see their sacred wood</l>
<l>Plagued by this impious brotherhood,</l>
<l>The troubled saints away would roam</l>
<l>And seek in other shades a home:</l>
<l>Hence will we fly, O Ráma, ere</l>
<l>The cruel fiends our bodies tear.</l>
<l>Not far away a forest lies</l>
<l>Rich in the roots and fruit we prize,</l>
<l>To this will I and all repair</l>
<l>And join the holy hermits there;</l>
<l>Be wise, and with us thither flee</l>
<l>Before this Khara injure thee.</l>
<l>Mighty art thou, O Ráma, yet</l>
<l>Each day with peril is beset.</l>
<l>If with thy consort by thy side</l>

<l><q>And naught remains to wish beside.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She spake; the lady's meek reply</l>
<l>Swelled Anasúyá's rapture high.</l>
<l><q>Sítá,</q> she said, <q rend="pre">my gift to-day</q></l>
<l>Thy sweet contentment shall repay.</l>
<l>Accept this precious robe to wear,</l>
<l>Of heavenly fabric, rich and rare,</l>
<l>These gems thy limbs to ornament,</l>
<l>This precious balsam sweet of scent.</l>
<l>O Maithil dame, this gift of mine</l>
<l>Shall make thy limbs with beauty shine,</l>
<l>And breathing o'er thy frame dispense</l>
<l>Its pure and lasting influence.</l>
<l>This balsam on thy fair limbs spread</l>
<l>New radiance on thy lord shall shed,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Sítá took the gift the dame</l>
<l>Bestowed on her in friendship's name,</l>
<l>The balsam, gems, and robe divine,</l>
<l>And garlands wreathed of bloomy twine;</l>
<l>Then sat her down, with reverence meet,</l>
<l>At saintly Anasúyá's feet.</l>
<l>The matron rich in rites and vows</l>
<l>Turned her to Ráma's Maithil spouse,</l>
<l>And questioned thus in turn to hear</l>
<l>A pleasant tale to charm her ear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Sítá, 'tis said that Raghu's son</q></l>
<l>Thy hand, mid gathered suitors, won.</l>

<l>Do thou repeat each thing that passed,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Reviewing all from first to last.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the dame to Sítá: she</l>
<l>Replying to the devotee,</l>
<l><q>Then, lady, thy attention lend,</q></l>
<l>Rehearsed the story to the end:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">King Janak, just and brave and strong,</q></l>
<l>Who loves the right and hates the wrong,</l>
<l>Well skilled in what the law ordains</l>
<l>For Warriors, o'er Videha reigns.</l>
<l>Guiding one morn the plough, his hand</l>
<l>Marked out, for rites the sacred land,</l>
<l>When, as the ploughshare cleft the earth,</l>
<l>Child of the king I leapt to birth.</l>
<l>Then as the ground he smoothed and cleared,</l>
<l>He saw me all with dust besmeared,</l>
<l>And on the new-found babe, amazed</l>
<l>The ruler of Videha gazed.</l>
<l>In childless love the monarch pressed</l>
<l>The welcome infant to his breast:</l>
<l><q>My daughter,</q> thus he cried, <q>is she:</q></l>
<l>And as his child he cared for me.</l>
<l>Forth from the sky was heard o'erhead</l>
<l>As 'twere a human voice that said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Yea, even so: great King, this child</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Henceforth thine own be justly styled.</q></l>
<l>Videha's monarch, virtuous souled,</l>
<l>Rejoiced o'er me with joy untold,</l>
<l>Delighting in his new-won prize,</l>
<l>The darling of his heart and eyes.</l>
<l>To his chief queen of saintly mind</l>
<l>The precious treasure he consigned,</l>
<l>And by her side she saw me grow,</l>
<l>Nursed with the love which mothers know.</l>
<pb n="228"/><anchor id="Pg228"/>
<l>Then as he saw the seasons fly,</l>
<l>And knew my marriage-time was nigh,</l>
<l>My sire was vexed with care, as sad</l>
<l>As one who mourns the wealth he had:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Scorn on the maiden's sire must wait</q></l>
<l>From men of high and low estate:</l>
<l>The virgin's father all despise,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Though Indra's peer, who rules the skies.</q></l>
<l>More near he saw, and still more near,</l>
<l>The scorn that filled his soul with fear,</l>
<l>On trouble's billowy ocean tossed,</l>
<l>Like one whose shattered bark is lost.</l>
<l>My father knowing how I came,</l>
<l>No daughter of a mortal dame,</l>
<l>In all the regions failed to see</l>
<l>A bridegroom meet to match with me.</l>
<l>Each way with anxious thought he scanned,</l>
<l>And thus at length the monarch planned:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The Bride's Election will I hold,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">With every rite prescribed of old.</q></l>
<l>It pleased King Varuṇ to bestow</l>
<l>Quiver and shafts and heavenly bow</l>
<l>Upon my father's sire who reigned,</l>
<l>When Daksha his great rite ordained.</l>
<l>Where was the man might bend or lift</l>
<l>With utmost toil that wondrous gift?</l>
<l>Not e'en in dreams could mortal king</l>
<l>Strain the great bow or draw the string.</l>
<l>Of this tremendous bow possessed,</l>
<l>My truthful father thus addressed</l>
<l>The lords of many a region, all</l>
<l>Assembled at the monarch's call:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Whoe'er this bow can manage, he</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The husband of my child shall be.</q></l>
<l>The suitors viewed with hopeless eyes</l>
<l>That wondrous bow of mountain size,</l>
<l>Then to my sire they bade adieu,</l>
<l>And all with humbled hearts withdrew.</l>
<l>At length with Viśvámitra came</l>
<l>This son of Raghu, dear to fame,</l>
<l>The royal sacrifice to view.</l>
<l>Near to my father's home he drew,</l>
<l>His brother Lakshmaṇ by his side,</l>
<l>Ráma, in deeds heroic tried.</l>
<l>My sire with honour entertained</l>
<l>The saint in lore of duty trained,</l>
<l>Who thus in turn addressed the king:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ráma and Lakshmaṇ here who spring</q></l>
<l>From royal Daśaratha, long</l>
<l><q rend="post">To see thy bow so passing strong.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the prince's eyes was laid</l>
<l>That marvel, as the Bráhman prayed.</l>
<l>One moment on the bow he gazed,</l>
<l>Quick to the notch the string he raised,</l>
<l>Then, in the wandering people's view,</l>
<l>The cord with mighty force he drew.</l>
<l>Then with an awful crash as loud</l>
<l>As thunderbolts that cleave the cloud,</l>
<l>The bow beneath the matchless strain</l>
<l>Of arms heroic snapped in twain.</l>
<l>Thus, giving purest water, he,</l>
<l>My sire, to Ráma offered me.</l>
<l>The prince the offered gift declined</l>
<l>Till he should learn his father's mind;</l>
<l>So horsemen swift Ayodhyá sought</l>
<l>And back her aged monarch brought.</l>
<l>Me then my sire to Ráma gave,</l>
<l>Self-ruled, the bravest of the brave.</l>
<l>And Urmilá, the next to me,</l>
<l>Graced with all gifts, most fair to see,</l>
<l>My sire with Raghu's house allied,</l>
<l>And gave her to be Lakshmaṇ's bride.</l>
<l>Thus from the princes of the land</l>
<l>Lord Ráma won my maiden hand,</l>
<l>And him exalted high above</l>

<l>When Anasúyá, virtuous-souled,</l>

<l>Her loving arms around her waist.</l>

<l>Thy pleasant tale has charmed mine ear,</l>

<l>And left the world to holy Night.</l>
<l>Hark! how the leafy thickets sound</l>
<l>With gathering birds that twitter round:</l>
<l>They sought their food by day, and all</l>
<l>Flock homeward when the shadows fall.</l>
<l>See, hither comes the hermit band,</l>
<l>Each with his pitcher in his hand:</l>
<l>Fresh from the bath, their locks are wet,</l>

<l>Here saints their fires of worship tend,</l>

<l>The night o'er all the sky is spread,</l>

<l>The hero prince with joy surveyed</l>

<l>She told him how the saint to show</l>

<head>Canto I. The Hermitage.</head>

<lg>
<l>When Ráma, valiant hero, stood</l>
<l>In the vast shade of Daṇḍak wood,</l>
<l>His eyes on every side he bent</l>
<l>And saw a hermit settlement,</l>
<l>Where coats of bark were hung around,</l>
<l>And holy grass bestrewed the ground.</l>
<l>Bright with Bráhmanic lustre glowed</l>
<l>That circle where the saints abode:</l>
<l>Like the hot sun in heaven it shone,</l>
<l>Too dazzling to be looked upon.</l>
<l>Wild creatures found a refuge where</l>
<l>The court, well-swept, was bright and fair,</l>
<l>And countless birds and roedeer made</l>
<l>Their dwelling in the friendly shade.</l>
<l>Beneath the boughs of well-loved trees</l>
<l>Oft danced the gay Apsarases.<note place="foot">Heavenly nymphs.</note></l>
<l>Around was many an ample shed</l>
<l>Wherein the holy fire was fed;</l>
<l>With sacred grass and skins of deer,</l>
<l>Ladles and sacrificial gear,</l>
<l>And roots and fruit, and wood to burn,</l>
<l>And many a brimming water-urn.</l>
<l>Tall trees their hallowed branches spread,</l>
<l>Laden with pleasant fruit, o'erhead;</l>
<l>And gifts which holy laws require,<note place="foot">The <hi rend='italic'>ball</hi>
or present of food to all created beings.</note></l>
<l>And solemn offerings burnt with fire,<note place="foot">The clarified butter &amp;c.
cast into the sacred fire.</note></l>
<l>And Veda chants on every side</l>
<l>That home of hermits sanctified.</l>
<l>There many a flower its odour shed,</l>
<l>And lotus blooms the lake o'erspred.</l>
<l>There, clad in coats of bark and hide,—</l>
<l>Their food by roots and fruit supplied,—</l>
<l>Dwelt many an old and reverend sire</l>
<l>Bright as the sun or Lord of Fire,</l>
<l>All with each worldly sense subdued,</l>
<l>A pure and saintly multitude.</l>
<l>The Veda chants, the saints who trod</l>
<l>The sacred ground and mused on God,</l>
<l>Made that delightful grove appear</l>
<l>Like Brahmá's own most glorious sphere.</l>
<l>As Raghu's splendid son surveyed</l>
<l>That hermit home and tranquil shade,</l>
<l>He loosed his mighty bow-string, then</l>
<l>Drew nearer to the holy men.</l>
<pb n="230"/><anchor id="Pg230"/>
<l>With keen celestial sight endued</l>
<l>Those mighty saints the chieftain viewed,</l>
<l>With joy to meet the prince they came,</l>
<l>And gentle Sítá dear to fame.</l>
<l>They looked on virtuous Ráma, fair</l>
<l>As Soma<note place="foot">The Moon-God: <q>he is,</q> says the commentator,
<q>the special deity of Bráhmans.</q></note> in the evening air,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ by his brother's side,</l>
<l>And Sítá long in duty tried,</l>
<l>And with glad blessings every sage</l>
<l>Received them in the hermitage.</l>
<l>Then Ráma's form and stature tall</l>
<l>Entranced the wondering eyes of all,—</l>
<l>His youthful grace, his strength of limb,</l>
<l>And garb that nobly sat on him.</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ too their looks they raised,</l>
<l>And upon Sítá's beauty gazed</l>
<l>With eyes that closed not lest their sight</l>
<l>Should miss the vision of delight.</l>
<l>Then the pure hermits of the wood,</l>
<l>Rejoicing in all creatures' good,</l>
<l>Their guest, the glorious Ráma, led</l>
<l>Within a cot with leaves o'erhead.</l>
<l>With highest honour all the best</l>
<l>Of radiant saints received their guest,</l>
<l>With kind observance, as is meet,</l>
<l>And gave him water for his feet.</l>
<l>To highest pitch of rapture wrought</l>
<l>Their stores of roots and fruit they brought.</l>
<l>They poured their blessings on his head,</l>
<l>And <q>All we have is thine,</q> they said.</l>
<l>Then, reverent hand to hand applied,<note place="foot"><q>Because he was an
incarnation of the deity,</q> says the commentator, <q>otherwise such honour paid by
men of the sacerdotal caste to one of the military would be improper.</q></note></l>
<l>Each duty-loving hermit cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The king is our protector, bright</q></l>
<l>In fame, maintainer of the right.</l>
<l>He bears the awful sword, and hence</l>
<l>Deserves an elder's reverence.</l>
<l>One fourth of Indra's essence, he</l>
<l>Preserves his realm from danger free,</l>
<l>Hence honoured by the world of right</l>
<l>The king enjoys each choice delight.</l>
<l>Thou shouldst to us protection give,</l>
<l>For in thy realm, dear lord, we live:</l>
<l>Whether in town or wood thou be,</l>
<l>Thou art our king, thy people we.</l>
<l>Our wordly aims are laid aside,</l>
<l>Our hearts are tamed and purified.</l>
<l>To thee our guardian, we who earn</l>
<l><q rend="post">Our only wealth by penance turn.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then the pure dwellers in the shade</l>
<l>To Raghu's son due honour paid,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ, bringing store of roots,</l>
<l>And many a flower, and woodland fruits.</l>
<l>And others strove the prince to please</l>
<l>With all attentive courtesies.</l>

<lg>
<l>Thus entertained he passed the night,</l>
<l>Then, with the morning's early light,</l>
<l>To all the hermits bade adieu</l>
<l>And sought his onward way anew.</l>
<l>He pierced the mighty forest where</l>
<l>Roamed many a deer and pard and bear:</l>
<l>Its ruined pools he scarce could see.</l>
<l>For creeper rent and prostrate tree,</l>
<l>Where shrill cicada's cries were heard,</l>
<l>And plaintive notes of many a bird.</l>
<l>Deep in the thickets of the wood</l>
<l>With Lakshmaṇ and his spouse he stood,</l>
<l>There in the horrid shade he saw</l>
<l>A giant passing nature's law:</l>
<l>Vast as some mountain-peak in size,</l>
<l>With mighty voice and sunken eyes,</l>
<l>Huge, hideous, tall, with monstrous face,</l>
<l>Most ghastly of his giant race.</l>
<l>A tiger's hide the Rákshas wore</l>
<l>Still reeking with the fat and gore:</l>
<l>Huge-faced, like Him who rules the dead,</l>
<l>All living things he struck with dread.</l>
<l>Three lions, tigers four, ten deer</l>
<l>He carried on his iron spear,</l>
<l>Two wolves, an elephant's head beside</l>
<l>With mighty tusks which blood-drops dyed.</l>
<l>When on the three his fierce eye fell,</l>
<l>He charged them with a roar and yell</l>
<l>As furious as the grisly King</l>
<l>When stricken worlds are perishing.</l>
<l>Then with a mighty roar that shook</l>
<l>The earth beneath their feet, he took</l>
<l>The trembling Sítá to his side.</l>
<l>Withdrew a little space, and cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ha, short lived wretches, ye who dare,</q></l>
<l>In hermit dress with matted hair,</l>
<l>Armed each with arrows, sword, and bow,</l>
<l>Through Daṇḍak's pathless wood to go:</l>
<l>How with one dame, I bid you tell,</l>
<l>Can you among ascetics dwell?</l>
<l>Who are ye, sinners, who despise</l>
<l>The right, in holy men's disguise?</l>
<l>The great Virádha, day by day</l>
<l>Through this deep-tangled wood I stray,</l>
<l>And ever, armed with trusty steel,</l>
<l>I seize a saint to make my meal.</l>
<l>This woman young and fair of frame</l>
<l>Shall be the conquering giant's dame:</l>
<l>Your blood, ye things of evil life,</l>
<l><q rend="post">My lips shall quaff in battle strife.</q></l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: and Janak's hapless child,</l>
<l>Scared by his speech so fierce and wild,</l>
<pb n="231"/><anchor id="Pg231"/>
<l>Trembled for terror, as a frail</l>
<l>Young plantain shivers in the gale.</l>
<l>When Ráma saw Virádha clasp</l>
<l>Fair Sítá in his mighty grasp,</l>
<l>Thus with pale lips that terror dried</l>
<l>The hero to his brother cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O see Virádha's arm enfold</q></l>
<l>My darling in its cursed hold,—</l>
<l>The child of Janak best of kings,</l>
<l>My spouse whose soul to virtue clings,</l>
<l>Sweet princess, with pure glory bright,</l>
<l>Nursed in the lap of soft delight.</l>
<l>Now falls the blow Kaikeyí meant,</l>
<l>Successful in her dark intent:</l>
<l>This day her cruel soul will be</l>
<l>Triumphant over thee and me.</l>
<l>Though Bharat on the throne is set,</l>
<l>Her greedy eyes look farther yet:</l>
<l>Me from my home she dared expel,</l>
<l>Me whom all creatures loved so well.</l>
<l>This fatal day at length, I ween,</l>
<l>Brings triumph to the younger queen.</l>
<l>I see with bitterest grief and shame</l>
<l>Another touch the Maithil dame.</l>
<l>Not loss of sire and royal power</l>
<l><q rend="post">So grieves me as this mournful hour.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in his anguish cried the chief:</l>
<l>Then drowned in tears, o'erwhelmed by grief,</l>
<l>Thus Lakshmaṇ in his anger spake,</l>
<l>Quick panting like a spell-bound snake:</l>
</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Canst thou, my brother, Indra's peer,</q></l>

<l>The fury which my soul at first</l>
<l>Upon usurping Bharat nursed,</l>
<l>On this Virádha will I wreak</l>
<l>As Indra splits the mountain peak.</l>
<l>Winged by this arm's impetuous might</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My shaft with deadly force</l>

<l>So loud the roar which chilled with fear,</l>

<l>And ever as the monster gaped</l>
<l>Those arrows from his jaws escaped.</l>
<l>Preserving still his life unharmed,</l>
<l>By Brahmá's saving promise charmed,</l>

<l>Dire as the flaming levin sent</l>

<l>Cut by the shafts he guided well</l>
<l>To earth the giant's weapon fell:</l>
<l>As when from Meru's summit, riven</l>

<l>Then swift his sword each warrior drew,</l>
<l>Like a dread serpent black of hue,</l>

<l>But Sítá viewed with wild affright</l>
<l>The heroes hurried from her sight.</l>
<l>She tossed her shapely arms on high,</l>
<l>And shrieked aloud her bitter cry:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah, the dread giant bears away</q></l>
<l>The princely Ráma as his prey,</l>

<l>Then Lakshmaṇ with resistless stroke</l>
<l>The foe's left arm that held him broke,</l>

<l>Then rushed they on, and crushed and beat</l>
<l>Their foe with arms and fists and feet,</l>
<l>And nerved each mighty limb to pound</l>
<l>And bray him on the level ground.</l>
<l>Keen arrows and each biting blade</l>
<l>Wide rents in breast and side had made;</l>
<l>But crushed and torn and mangled, still</l>
<l>The monster lived they could not kill.</l>
<l>When Ráma saw no arms might slay</l>
<l>The fiend who like a mountain lay,</l>
<l>The glorious hero, swift to save</l>
<l>In danger, thus his counsel gave:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Prince of men, his charmed life</q></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, the son of Raghu pressed</l>

<l>With joy the prostrate monster heard</l>
<l>Victorious Ráma's welcome word,</l>

<l>There stands the high-born Maithil dame,</l>

<l>My name was Tumburu,<note place="foot">Somewhat inconsistently with this part

<l>For loving Rambhá's<note place="foot">Rambhá appears in <ref target="CantoI-LXIV">Book

<l>By thee, to heaven again shall go.</l>
<l>A league, O Prince, beyond this spot</l>

<l>The very sun is not more bright</l>
<l>Than that most glorious anchorite:</l>
<l>To him, O Ráma, quickly turn,</l>

<l>First under earth my body throw,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, by the rankling dart oppressed,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake Virádha ere he died;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, the valiant hero put</l>

<l>His spade obedient Lakshmaṇ plied,</l>

<l>Then Raghu's son his foot withdrew,</l>

<l>The heroes, to their purpose true,</l>

<lg>
<l>Then Ráma, having slain in fight</l>
<l>Virádha of terrific might,</l>
<l>With gentle words his spouse consoled,</l>
<l>And clasped her in his loving hold.</l>
<l>Then to his brother nobly brave</l>
<l>The valiant prince his counsel gave:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Wild are these woods around us spread;</q></l>
<l>And hard and rough the ground to tread:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma spoke, and took the road</l>
<l>To Śarabhanga's pure abode.</l>
<l>But near that saint whose lustre vied</l>
<l>With Gods, by penance purified,</l>
<l>With startled eyes the prince beheld</l>
<l>A wondrous sight unparalleled.</l>
<l>In splendour like the fire and sun</l>
<l>He saw a great and glorious one.</l>
<l>Upon a noble car he rode,</l>
<l>And many a God behind him glowed:</l>
<l>And earth beneath his feet unpressed<note place="foot"><q>Even when he had
alighted,</q> says the commentator: The feet of Gods do not touch the ground.</note></l>
<l>The monarch of the skies confessed.</l>
<l>Ablaze with gems, no dust might dim</l>
<l>The bright attire that covered him.</l>
<l>Arrayed like him, on every side</l>
<l>High saints their master glorified.</l>
<l>Near, borne in air, appeared in view</l>
<l>His car which tawny coursers drew,</l>
<l>Like silver cloud, the moon, or sun</l>
<l>Ere yet the day is well begun.</l>
<l>Wreathed with gay garlands, o'er his head</l>
<l>A pure white canopy was spread,</l>
<l>And lovely nymphs stood nigh to hold</l>
<l>Fair chouris with their sticks of gold,</l>
<l>Which, waving in each gentle hand,</l>
<l>The forehead of their monarch fanned.</l>
<l>God, saint, and bard, a radiant ring,</l>
<l>Sang glory to their heavenly King:</l>
<l>Forth into joyful lauds they burst</l>
<l>As Indra with the sage conversed.</l>
<l>Then Ráma, when his wondering eyes</l>
<l>Beheld the monarch of the skies,</l>
<pb n="234"/><anchor id="Pg234"/>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ quickly called, and showed</l>
<l>The car wherein Lord Indra rode:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">See, brother, see that air-borne car,</q></l>
<l>Whose wondrous glory shines afar:</l>
<l>Wherefrom so bright a lustre streams</l>
<l>That like a falling sun it seems:</l>
<l>These are the steeds whose fame we know,</l>
<l>Of heavenly race through heaven they go:</l>
<l>These are the steeds who bear the yoke</l>
<l>Of Śakra,<note place="foot">A name of Indra.</note> Him whom all invoke.</l>
<l>Behold these youths, a glorious band,</l>
<l>Toward every wind a hundred stand:</l>
<l>A sword in each right hand is borne,</l>
<l>And rings of gold their arms adorn.</l>
<l>What might in every broad deep chest</l>
<l>And club-like arm is manifest!</l>
<l>Clothed in attire of crimson hue</l>
<l>They show like tigers fierce to view.</l>
<l>Great chains of gold each warder deck,</l>
<l>Gleaming like fire beneath his neck.</l>
<l>The age of each fair youth appears</l>
<l>Some score and five of human years:</l>
<l>The ever-blooming prime which they</l>
<l>Who live in heaven retain for aye:</l>
<l>Such mien these lordly beings wear,</l>
<l>Heroic youths, most bright and fair.</l>
<l>Now, brother, in this spot, I pray,</l>
<l>With the Videhan lady stay,</l>
<l>Till I have certain knowledge who</l>
<l><q rend="post">This being is, so bright to view.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and turning from the spot</l>
<l>Sought Śarabhanga's hermit cot.</l>
<l>But when the lord of Śachí<note place="foot">Śachí is the consort of Indra.</note>
saw</l>
<l>The son of Raghu near him draw,</l>
<l>He hastened of the sage to take</l>
<l>His leave, and to his followers spake:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">See, Ráma bends his steps this way,</q></l>
<l>But ere he yet a word can say,</l>

<l>In fitter time shall look on me.</l>
<l>Before him still a great emprise,</l>
<l><q rend="post">A task too hard for others, lies.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with all marks of honour high</l>
<l>The Thunderer bade the saint good-bye,</l>
<l>And in his car which coursers drew</l>
<l>Away to heaven the conqueror flew.</l>
<l>Then Ráma, Lakshmaṇ, and the dame,</l>
<l>To Śarabhanga nearer came,</l>
<l>Who sat beside the holy flame.</l>
<l>Before the ancient sage they bent,</l>
<l>And clasped his feet most reverent;</l>
<l>Then at his invitation found</l>
<l>A seat beside him on the ground.</l>
<l>Then Ráma prayed the sage would deign</l>
<l>Lord Indra's visit to explain;</l>
<l>And thus at length the holy man</l>
<l>In answer to his prayer began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>

<l>But when I knew that thou wast nigh,</l>
<l>To Brahmá's world I could not fly</l>
<l>Until these longing eyes were blest</l>
<l>With seeing thee, mine honoured guest.</l>
<l>Since thou, O Prince, hast cheered my sight,</l>
<l>Great-hearted lover of the right,</l>
<l>To heavenly spheres will I repair</l>
<l>And bliss supreme that waits me there.</l>

<l>To those fair worlds which ne'er decay,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">I, even I, illustrious sage,</q></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma, Indra's peer in might,</l>

<lg>
<l>So Raghu's son, his foemen's dread,</l>
<l>With Sítá and his brother sped,</l>
<l>Girt round by many a twice-born sage,</l>
<l>To good Sutíkshṇa's hermitage.<note place="foot">Near the celebrated Rámagiri or
Ráma's Hill, now Rám-ṭek, near Nagpore—the scene of the Yaksha's exile in the
<hi rend='italic'>Messenger Cloud</hi>.</note></l>
<l>Through woods for many a league he passed,</l>
<l>O'er rushing rivers full and fast,</l>
<l>Until a mountain fair and bright</l>
<l>As lofty Meru rose in sight.</l>
<l>Within its belt of varied wood</l>
<l>Ikshváku's sons and Sítá stood,</l>
<l>Where trees of every foliage bore</l>
<l>Blossom and fruit in endless store.</l>
<l>There coats of bark, like garlands strung,</l>
<l>Before a lonely cottage hung,</l>
<l>And there a hermit, dust-besmeared,</l>
<l>A lotus on his breast, appeared.</l>
<l>Then Ráma with obeisance due</l>
<l>Addressed the sage, as near he drew:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My name is Ráma, lord; I seek</q></l>
<l>Thy presence, saint, with thee to speak.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sage his eyes on Ráma bent,</l>
<l>Of virtue's friends preëminent;</l>
<l>Then words like these he spoke, and pressed</l>
<l>The son of Raghu to his breast:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Welcome to thee, illustrious youth,</q></l>
<l>Best champion of the rights of truth!</l>
<l>By thine approach this holy ground</l>

<l>I could not quit this mortal frame</l>

<l>To heavenly spheres I would not rise,</l>
<l>Expecting thee with eager eyes.</l>
<l>I knew that thou, unkinged, hadst made</l>
<l>Thy home in Chitrakúṭa's shade.</l>
<l>E'en now, O Ráma, Indra, lord</l>
<l>Supreme by all the Gods adored,</l>
<l>King of the Hundred Offerings,<note place="foot">A hundred <foreign lang="sa"

<l>My choice of all the worlds have won.</l>

<l>To Brahmá's gracious speech replies:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I of myself those worlds will win,</q></l>
<l>O mighty hermit pure from sin:</l>
<l>But now, O saint, I pray thee tell</l>
<l>Where I within this wood may dwell:</l>

<l>The son of Gautama, was told</l>
<l>That thou in every lore art wise,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to the saint, whose glories high</l>
<l>Filled all the world, he made reply:</l>
<l>And thus again the holy man</l>
<l>His pleasant speech with joy began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This calm retreat, O Prince, is blest</q></l>
<l>With many a charm: here take thy rest.</l>
<l>Here roots and kindly fruits abound,</l>
<l>And hermits love the holy ground.</l>
<l>Fair silvan beasts and gentle deer</l>
<l>In herds unnumbered wander here:</l>
<l>And as they roam, secure from harm,</l>
<l>Our eyes with grace and beauty charm:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hermit's speech when Ráma heard,—</l>
<l>The hero ne'er by terror stirred,—</l>
<l>On his great bow his hand he laid,</l>

<l><q rend="pre">O saint, my darts of keenest steel,</q></l>
<l>Armed with their murderous barbs, would deal</l>
<l>Destruction mid the silvan race</l>
<l>That flocks around thy dwelling-place.</l>

<l>So Ráma and Sumitrá's son,</l>
<l>When every honour due was done,</l>
<l>Slept through the night. When morning broke,</l>
<l>The heroes from their rest awoke.</l>
<l>Betimes the son of Raghu rose,</l>
<l>With gentle Sítá, from repose,</l>
<l>And sipped the cool delicious wave</l>
<l>Sweet with the scent the lotus gave,</l>
<l>Then to the Gods and sacred flame</l>
<l>The heroes and the lady came,</l>
<l>And bent their heads in honour meet</l>
<l>Within the hermit's pure retreat.</l>
<l>When every stain was purged away,</l>
<l>They saw the rising Lord of Day:</l>
<l>Then to Sutíkshṇa's side they went,</l>
<l>And softly spoke, most reverent:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Well have we slept, O holy lord,</q></l>
<l>Honoured of thee by all adored:</l>
<l>Now leave to journey forth we pray:</l>
<l>These hermits urge us on our way.</l>
<l>We haste to visit, wandering by,</l>
<l>The ascetics' homes that round you lie,</l>
<l>And roaming Daṇḍak's mighty wood</l>
<l>To view each saintly brotherhood,</l>
<l>For thy permission now we sue,</l>
<l>With these high saints to duty true,</l>
<l>By penance taught each sense to tame,—</l>
<l>In lustre like the smokeless flame.</l>
<l>Ere on our brows the sun can beat</l>
<l>With fierce intolerable heat.</l>
<l>Like some unworthy lord who wins</l>
<l>His power by tyranny and sins,</l>
<l><q rend="post">O saint, we fain would part.</q> The three</l>
<l>Bent humbly to the devotee.</l>
<l>He raised the princes as they pressed</l>
<l>His feet, and strained them to his breast;</l>
<l>And then the chief of devotees</l>
<l>Bespake them both in words like these:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Go with thy brother, Ráma, go,</q></l>
<l>Pursue thy path untouched by woe:</l>
<l>Go with thy faithful Sítá, she</l>
<l>Still like a shadow follows thee.</l>
<l>Roam Daṇḍak wood observing well</l>
<l>The pleasant homes where hermits dwell,—</l>
<l>Pure saints whose ordered souls adhere</l>
<l>To penance rites and vows austere.</l>
<l>There plenteous roots and berries grow,</l>
<l>And noble trees their blossoms show,</l>
<l>And gentle deer and birds of air</l>
<l>In peaceful troops are gathered there.</l>
<l>There see the full-blown lotus stud</l>
<l>The bosom of the lucid flood,</l>
<l>And watch the joyous mallard shake</l>
<l>The reeds that fringe the pool and lake.</l>
<l>See with delighted eye the rill</l>
<l>Leap sparkling from her parent hill,</l>
<l>And hear the woods that round thee lie</l>
<l>Reëcho to the peacock's cry.</l>
<l>And as I bid thy brother, so,</l>
<l>Sumitrá's child, I bid thee go.</l>
<l>Go forth, these varied beauties see,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And then once more return to me.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the sage Sutíkshṇa: both</l>
<l>The chiefs assented, nothing loth,</l>
<l>Round him with circling steps they paced,</l>
<l>Then for the road prepared with haste.</l>
<l>There Sítá stood, the dame long-eyed,</l>
<l>Fair quivers round their waists she tied,</l>
<l>And gave each prince his trusty bow,</l>
<l>And sword which ne'er a spot might know.</l>
<l>Each took his quiver from her hand.</l>
<l>And clanging bow and gleaming brand:</l>
<l>Then from the hermits' home the two</l>
<l>Went forth each woodland scene to view.</l>
<l>Each beauteous in the bloom of age,</l>
<l>Dismissed by that illustrious sage,</l>
<l>With bow and sword accoutred, hied</l>

<head>Canto IX. Sítá's Speech.</head>

<lg>
<l>Blest by the sage, when Raghu's son</l>
<l>His onward journey had begun,</l>
<l>Thus in her soft tone Sítá, meek</l>
<l>With modest fear, began to speak:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">One little slip the great may lead</q></l>
<l>To shame that follows lawless deed:</l>
<l>Such shame, my lord, as still must cling</l>
<l>To faults from low desire that spring.</l>
<l>Three several sins defile the soul,</l>
<l>Born of desire that spurns control:</l>
<l>First, utterance of a lying word,</l>
<l>Then, viler both, the next, and third:</l>
<l>The lawless love of other's wife,</l>
<l>The thirst of blood uncaused by strife.</l>
<l>The first, O Raghu's son, in thee</l>
<l>None yet has found, none e'er shall see.</l>
<l>Love of another's dame destroys</l>
<l>All merit, lost for guilty joys:</l>
<l>Ráma, such crime in thee, I ween,</l>
<l>Has ne'er been found, shall ne'er be seen:</l>
<l>The very thought, my princely lord,</l>
<l>Is in thy secret soul abhorred.</l>
<pb n="238"/><anchor id="Pg238"/>
<l>For thou hast ever been the same</l>
<l>Fond lover of thine own dear dame,</l>
<l>Content with faithful heart to do</l>
<l>Thy father's will, most just and true:</l>
<l>Justice, and faith, and many a grace</l>
<l>In thee have found a resting-place.</l>
<l>Such virtues, Prince, the good may gain</l>
<l>Who empire o'er each sense retain;</l>
<l>And well canst thou, with loving view</l>
<l>Regarding all, each sense subdue.</l>
<l>But for the third, the lust that strives,</l>
<l>Insatiate still, for others' lives,—</l>
<l>Fond thirst of blood where hate is none,—</l>
<l>This, O my lord, thou wilt not shun.</l>
<l>Thou hast but now a promise made,</l>
<l>The saints of Daṇḍak wood to aid:</l>
<l>And to protect their lives from ill</l>
<l>The giants' blood in tight wilt spill:</l>
<l>And from thy promise lasting fame</l>
<l>Will glorify the forest's name.</l>
<l>Armed with thy bow and arrows thou</l>
<l>Forth with thy brother journeyest now,</l>
<l>While as I think how true thou art</l>
<l>Fears for thy bliss assail my heart,</l>
<l>And all my spirit at the sight</l>
<l>Is troubled with a strange affright.</l>
<l>I like it not—it seems not good—</l>
<l>Thy going thus to Daṇḍak wood:</l>
<l>And I, if thou wilt mark me well,</l>
<l>The reason of my fear will tell.</l>
<l>Thou with thy brother, bow in hand,</l>
<l>Beneath those ancient trees wilt stand,</l>
<l>And thy keen arrows will not spare</l>
<l>Wood-rovers who will meet thee there.</l>
<l>For as the fuel food supplies</l>
<l>That bids the dormant flame arise,</l>
<l>Thus when the warrior grasps his bow</l>
<l>He feels his breast with ardour glow.</l>
<l>Deep in a holy grove, of yore,</l>
<l>Where bird and beast from strife forbore,</l>
<l>Śuchi beneath the sheltering boughs,</l>
<l>A truthful hermit kept his vows.</l>
<l>Then Indra, Śachí's heavenly lord,</l>
<l>Armed like a warrior with a sword,</l>
<l>Came to his tranquil home to spoil</l>
<l>The hermit of his holy toil,</l>
<l>And left the glorious weapon there</l>
<l>Entrusted to the hermit's care,</l>
<l>A pledge for him to keep, whose mind</l>
<l>To fervent zeal was all resigned.</l>
<l>He took the brand: with utmost heed</l>
<l>He kept it for the warrior's need:</l>
<l>To keep his trust he fondly strove</l>
<l>When roaming in the neighbouring grove:</l>
<l>Whene'er for roots and fruit he strayed</l>
<l>Still by his side he bore the blade:</l>
<l>Still on his sacred charge intent,</l>
<l>He took his treasure when he went.</l>
<l>As day by day that brand he wore,</l>
<l>The hermit, rich in merit's store</l>
<l>From penance rites each thought withdrew,</l>
<l>And fierce and wild his spirit grew.</l>
<l>With heedless soul he spurned the right,</l>
<l>And found in cruel deeds delight.</l>
<l>So, living with the sword, he fell,</l>
<l>A ruined hermit, down to hell.</l>
<l>This tale applies to those who deal</l>
<l>Too closely with the warrior's steel:</l>
<l>The steel to warriors is the same</l>
<l>As fuel to the smouldering flame.</l>
<l>Sincere affection prompts my speech:</l>
<l>I honour where I fain would teach.</l>
<l>Mayst thou, thus armed with shaft and bow,</l>
<l>So dire a longing never know</l>
<l>As, when no hatred prompts the fray,</l>
<l>These giants of the wood to slay:</l>
<l>For he who kills without offence</l>
<l>Shall win but little glory thence.</l>
<l>The bow the warrior joys to bend</l>
<l>Is lent him for a nobler end,</l>
<l>That he may save and succour those</l>
<l>Who watch in woods when pressed by foes.</l>
<l>What, matched with woods, is bow or steel?</l>
<l>What, warrior's arm with hermit's zeal?</l>
<l>We with such might have naught to do:</l>
<l>The forest rule should guide us too.</l>
<l>But when Ayodhyá hails thee lord,</l>
<l>Be then thy warrior life restored:</l>
<l>So shall thy sire<note place="foot">Gorresio observes that Daśaratha was

<l>In bliss that naught may e'er destroy.</l>
<l>And if, resigning empire, thou</l>
<l>Submit thee to the hermit's vow,</l>

<l>But the three worlds are open thrown</l>
<l>To thee, by whom all things are known.</l>

<l>The words that Sítá uttered, spurred</l>
<l>By truest love, the hero heard:</l>
<l>Then he who ne'er from virtue strayed</l>
<l>To Janak's child his answer made:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">In thy wise speech, sweet love, I find</q></l>
<l>True impress of thy gentle mind,</l>
<l>Well skilled the warrior's path to trace,</l>
<l>Thou pride of Janak's ancient race.</l>
<l>What fitting answer shall I frame</l>
<l>To thy good words, my honoured dame?</l>
<l>Thou sayst the warrior bears the bow</l>
<l>That misery's tears may cease to flow;</l>
<l>And those pure saints who love the shade</l>
<l>Of Daṇḍak wood are sore dismayed.</l>
<l>They sought me of their own accord,</l>
<l>With suppliant prayers my aid implored:</l>
<l>They, fed on roots and fruit, who spend</l>
<l>Their lives where bosky wilds extend,</l>
<l>My timid love, enjoy no rest</l>
<l>By these malignant fiends distressed.</l>
<l>These make the flesh of man their meat:</l>
<l>The helpless saints they kill and eat.</l>
<l>The hermits sought my side, the chief</l>
<l>Of Bráhman race declared their grief.</l>
<l>I heard, and from my lips there fell</l>
<l>The words which thou rememberest well:</l>
<l>I listened as the hermits cried,</l>
<l>And to their prayers I thus replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Your favour, gracious lords, I claim,</q></l>
<l>O'erwhelmed with this enormous shame</l>

<l>And then before the saintly crowd,</l>
<l><q>What can I do?</q> I cried aloud.</l>
<l>Then from the trembling hermits broke</l>
<l>One long sad cry, and thus they spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Fiends of the wood, who wear at will</q></l>
<l>Each varied shape, afflict us still.</l>
<l>To thee in our distress we fly:</l>
<l>O help us, Ráma, or we die.</l>
<l>When sacred rites of fire are due,</l>
<l>When changing moons are full or new,</l>
<l>These fiends who bleeding flesh devour</l>
<l>Assail us with resistless power.</l>
<l>They with their cruel might torment</l>
<l>The hermits on their vows intent:</l>
<l>We look around for help and see</l>
<l>Our surest refuge, Prince, in thee.</l>
<l>We, armed with powers of penance, might</l>
<l>Destroy the rovers of the night:</l>
<l>But loth were we to bring to naught</l>
<l>The merit years of toil have bought.</l>
<l>Our penance rites are grown too hard,</l>
<l>By many a check and trouble barred,</l>
<l>But though our saints for food are slain</l>
<l>The withering curse we yet restrain.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus the troubled hermits prayed,</l>

<l>I must, enforced by high constraint,</l>

<l>As onward through the wood they went,</l>
<l>With great delight their eyes were bent</l>
<l>On rocky heights beside the way</l>
<l>And lofty trees with blossoms gay;</l>
<l>And streamlets running fair and fast</l>
<l>The royal youths with Sítá passed.</l>
<l>They watched the sáras and the drake</l>
<l>On islets of the stream and lake,</l>
<l>And gazed delighted on the floods</l>
<l>Bright with gay birds and lotus buds.</l>
<l>They saw in startled herds the roes,</l>
<l>The passion-frenzied buffaloes,</l>
<l>Wild elephants who fiercely tore</l>
<l>The tender trees, and many a boar.</l>
<l>A length of woodland way they passed,</l>
<l>And when the sun was low at last</l>
<l>A lovely stream-fed lake they spied,</l>
<l>Two leagues across from side to side.</l>
<l>Tall elephants fresh beauty gave</l>
<l>To grassy bank and lilied wave,</l>

<l>By many a swan and sáras stirred,</l>
<l>Mallard, and gay-winged water-bird.</l>
<l>From those sweet waters, loud and long,</l>
<l>Though none was seen to wake the song,</l>
<l>Swelled high the singer's music blent</l>
<l>With each melodious instrument.</l>
<l>Ráma and car-borne Lakshmaṇ heard</l>
<l>The charming strain, with wonder stirred,</l>
<l>Turned on the margent of the lake</l>
<l>To Dharmabhrit<note place="foot">One of the hermits who had followed

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Our longing souls, O hermit, burn</q></l>
<l>This music of the lake to learn:</l>

<l>He, as the son of Raghu prayed,</l>
<l>With swift accord his answer made,</l>
<l>And thus the hermit, virtuous-souled,</l>
<l>The story of the fair lake told:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Through every age 'tis known to fame,</q></l>

<l>By holy Máṇḍakarṇi wrought</l>
<l>With power his rites austere had bought.</l>
<l>For he, great votarist, intent</l>
<l>On strictest rule his stern life spent.</l>
<l>Ten thousand years the stream his bed,</l>
<l>Ten thousand years on air he fed.</l>
<l>Then on the blessed Gods who dwell</l>
<l>In heavenly homes great terror fell:</l>
<l>They gathered all, by Agni led,</l>
<l>And counselled thus disquieted:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The hermit by ascetic pain</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The seat of one of us would gain.</q></l>
<l>Thus with their hearts by fear oppressed</l>
<l>In full assembly spoke the Blest,</l>
<l>And bade five loveliest nymphs, as fair</l>
<l>As lightning in the evening air,</l>
<l>Armed with their winning wiles, seduce</l>
<l>From his stern vows the great recluse.</l>
<l>Though lore of earth and heaven he knew,</l>
<l>The hermit from his task they drew,</l>
<l>And made the great ascetic slave</l>
<l>To conquering love, the Gods to save.</l>
<l>Each of the heavenly five became,</l>
<l>Bound to the sage, his wedded dame;</l>
<l>And he, for his beloved's sake,</l>
<l>Formed a fair palace neath the lake.</l>
<l>Under the flood the ladies live,</l>
<l>To joy and ease their days they give,</l>
<l>And lap in bliss the hermit wooed</l>
<l>From penance rites to youth renewed.</l>
<l>So when the sportive nymphs within</l>

<l>The marvels of the tale he told.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As Ráma spake, his eyes were bent</l>
<l>Upon a hermit settlement</l>
<l>With light of heavenly lore endued,</l>
<l>With sacred grass and vesture strewed.</l>
<l>His wife and brother by his side,</l>
<l>Within the holy bounds he hied,</l>
<l>And there, with honour entertained</l>
<l>By all the saints, a while remained.</l>
<l>In time, by due succession led,</l>
<l>Each votary's cot he visited,</l>
<l>And then the lord of martial lore,</l>
<l>Returned where he had lodged before.</l>
<l>Here for the months, content, he stayed,</l>
<l>There for a year his visit paid:</l>
<l>Here for four months his home would fix,</l>
<l>There, as it chanced, for five or six.</l>
<l>Here for eight months and there for three</l>
<l>The son of Raghu's stay would be:</l>
<l>Here weeks, there fortnights, more or less,</l>
<l>He spent in tranquil happiness.</l>
<l>As there the hero dwelt at ease</l>
<l>Among those holy devotees,</l>
<l>In days untroubled o'er his head</l>
<l>Ten circling years of pleasure fled.</l>
<l>So Raghu's son in duty trained</l>
<l>A while in every cot remained,</l>
<l>Then with his dame retraced the road</l>
<l>To good Sutíkshṇa's calm abode.</l>
<l>Hailed by the saints with honours due</l>
<l>Near to the hermit's home he drew,</l>
<l>And there the tamer of his foes</l>
<l>Dwelt for a time in sweet repose.</l>
<l>One day within that holy wood</l>
<l>By saint Sutíkshṇa Ráma stood,</l>
<l>And thus the prince with reverence meek</l>
<l>To that high sage began to speak:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">In the wide woodlands that extend</q></l>
<l>Around us, lord most reverend,</l>
<l>As frequent voice of rumour tells,</l>
<l>Agastya, saintliest hermit, dwells.</l>
<l>So vast the wood, I cannot trace</l>
<l>The path to reach his dwelling place,</l>
<l>Nor, searching unassisted, find</l>
<l>That hermit of the thoughtful mind.</l>
<l>I with my wife and brother fain</l>
<l>Would go, his favour to obtain,</l>
<l>Would seek him in his lone retreat</l>
<l>And the great saint with reverence greet.</l>
<l>This one desire, O Master, long</l>

<l><q rend="post">My duty to that hermit lord.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus the prince whose heart was bent</l>
<l>On virtue told his firm intent,</l>
<l>The good Sutíkshṇa's joy rose high,</l>
<l>And thus in turn he made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The very thing, O Prince, which thou</q></l>

<l>Bid thee with wife and brother see</l>
<pb n="241"/><anchor id="Pg241"/>
<l>Agastya, glorious devotee.</l>
<l>I count this thing an omen fair</l>

<l>And I, my Prince, will gladly teach</l>
<l>The way Agastya's home to reach.</l>
<l>Southward, dear son, direct thy feet</l>
<l>Eight leagues beyond this still retreat:</l>
<l>Agastya's hermit brother there</l>
<l>Dwells in a home most bright and fair.</l>
<l>'Tis on a knoll of woody ground,</l>
<l>With many a branching Pippal<note place="foot">The holy fig-tree.</note> crowned:</l>
<l>There sweet birds' voices ne'er are mute,</l>
<l>And trees are gay with flower and fruit.</l>
<l>There many a lake gleams bright and cool,</l>
<l>And lilies deck each pleasant pool,</l>
<l>While swan, and crane, and mallard's wings</l>
<l>Are lovely in the water-springs.</l>
<l>There for one night, O Ráma, stay,</l>
<l>And with the dawn pursue thy way.</l>
<l>Still farther, bending southward, by</l>
<l>The thicket's edge the course must lie,</l>
<l>And thou wilt see, two leagues from thence</l>
<l>Agastya's lovely residence,</l>
<l>Set in the woodland's fairest spot,</l>
<l>All varied foliage decks the cot:</l>
<l>There Sítá, Lakshmaṇ thou, at ease</l>
<l>May spend sweet hours neath shady trees,</l>
<l>For all of noblest growth are found</l>
<l>Luxuriant on that bosky ground.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hermit spake, and Ráma bent</l>
<l>His head, with Lakshmaṇ, reverent,</l>
<l>And then with him and Janak's child</l>
<l>Set out to trace the forest wild.</l>
<l>He saw dark woods that fringed the road,</l>
<l>And distant hills like clouds that showed,</l>
<l>And, as the way he followed, met</l>
<l>With many a lake and rivulet.</l>
<l>So passing on with ease where led</l>
<l>The path Sutíkshṇa bade him tread,</l>
<l>The hero with exulting breast</l>
<l>His brother in these words addressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Here, surely, is the home, in sight,</q></l>
<l>Of that illustrious anchorite:</l>
<l>Here great Agastya's brother leads</l>
<l>A life intent on holy deeds.</l>
<l>Warned of each guiding mark and sign,</l>
<l>I see them all herein combine:</l>
<l>I see the branches bending low</l>
<l>Beneath the flowers and fruit they show.</l>
<l>A soft air from the forest springs,</l>
<l>Fresh from the odorous grass, and brings</l>
<l>A spicy fragrance as it flees</l>
<l>O'er the ripe fruit of Pippal trees.</l>
<l>See, here and there around us high</l>
<l>Piled up in heaps cleft billets lie,</l>
<l>And holy grass is gathered, bright</l>
<l>As strips of shining lazulite.</l>
<l>Full in the centre of the shade</l>
<l>The hermits' holy fire is laid:</l>
<l>I see its smoke the pure heaven streak</l>
<l>Dense as a big cloud's dusky peak.</l>
<l>The twice-born men their steps retrace</l>
<l>From each sequestered bathing-place,</l>
<l>And each his sacred gift has brought</l>
<l>Of blossoms which his hands have sought.</l>
<l>Of all these signs, dear brother, each</l>
<l>Agrees with good Sutíkshṇa's speech,</l>
<l>And doubtless in this holy bound</l>
<l>Agastya's brother will be found.</l>
<l>Agastya once, the worlds who viewed</l>
<l>With love, a Deathlike fiend subdued,</l>
<l>And armed with mighty power, obtained</l>
<l>By holy works, this grove ordained</l>
<l>To be a refuge and defence</l>
<l>From all oppressors' violence.</l>
<l>In days of yore within this place</l>
<l>Two brothers fierce of demon race,</l>
<l>Vátápi dire and Ilval, dwelt,</l>
<l>And slaughter mid the Bráhmans dealt.</l>
<l>A Bráhman's form, the fiend to cloak,</l>
<l>Fierce Ilval wore, and Sanskrit spoke,</l>
<l>And twice-born sages would invite</l>
<l>To solemnize some funeral rite.</l>
<l>His brother's flesh, concealed within</l>
<l>A ram's false shape and borrowed skin,—</l>
<l>As men are wont at funeral feasts,—</l>
<l>He dressed and fed those gathered priests.</l>
<l>The holy men, unweeting ill,</l>
<l>Took of the food and ate their fill.</l>
<l>Then Ilval with a mighty shout</l>
<l>Exclaimed <q>Vátápi, issue out.</q></l>
<l>Soon as his brother's voice he heard,</l>
<l>The fiend with ram-like bleating stirred:</l>
<l>Rending in pieces every frame,</l>
<l>Forth from the dying priests he came.</l>
<l>So they who changed their forms at will</l>
<l>Thousands of Bráhmans dared to kill,—</l>
<l>Fierce fiends who loved each cruel deed,</l>
<l>And joyed on bleeding flesh to feed.</l>
<l>Agastya, mighty hermit, pressed</l>
<l>To funeral banquet like the rest,</l>
<l>Obedient to the Gods' appeal</l>
<l>Ate up the monster at a meal.</l>
<l><q>'Tis done, 'tis done,</q> fierce Ilval cried,</l>
<l>And water for his hands supplied:</l>
<l>Then lifting up his voice he spake:</l>
<l><q>Forth, brother, from thy prison break.</q></l>
<l>Then him who called the fiend, who long</l>
<l>Had wrought the suffering Bráhmans wrong,</l>
<l>Thus thoughtful-souled Agastya, best</l>
<l>Of hermits, with a smile addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">How, Rákshas, is the fiend empowered</q></l>
<l>To issue forth whom I devoured?</l>
<l>Thy brother in a ram's disguise</l>
<l><q rend="post">Is gone where Yáma's kingdom lies.</q></l>
<pb n="242"/><anchor id="Pg242"/>
<l>When from the words Agastya said</l>
<l>He knew his brother fiend was dead,</l>
<l>His soul on fire with vengeful rage,</l>
<l>Rushed the night-rover at the sage.</l>
<l>One lightning glance of fury, hot</l>
<l>As fire, the glorious hermit shot,</l>
<l>As the fiend neared him in his stride,</l>
<l>And straight, consumed to dust, he died.</l>
<l>In pity for the Bráhmans' plight</l>
<l>Agastya wrought this deed of might:</l>
<l>This grove which lakes and fair trees grace</l>
<l><q rend="post">In his great brother's dwelling place.</q></l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As Ráma thus the tale rehearsed,</l>

<l>The setting sun his last rays shed,</l>
<l>And evening o'er the land was spread.</l>
<l>A while the princely brothers stayed</l>
<l>And even rites in order paid,</l>
<l>Then to the holy grove they drew</l>
<l>And hailed the saint with honour due.</l>
<l>With courtesy was Ráma met</l>
<l>By that illustrious anchoret,</l>
<l>And for one night he rested there</l>
<l>Regaled with fruit and hermit fare.</l>
<l>But when the night had reached its close,</l>
<l>And the sun's glorious circle rose,</l>
<l>The son of Raghu left his bed</l>
<l>And to the hermit's brother said:</l>

<l><q>Go, Ráma go,</q> the sage replied:</l>
<l>Then from the cot the chieftain hied.</l>
<l>And while the pleasant grove he viewed,</l>
<l>The path the hermit showed, pursued.</l>
<l>Of every leaf, of changing hue.</l>
<l>Plants, trees by hundreds round him grew,</l>
<l>With joyous eyes he looked on all,</l>
<l>Then Jak,<note place="foot">The bread-fruit tree, Artocarpus integrifolia.</note>
the wild rice, and Sál;<note place="foot">A fine timber tree, Shorea robusta.</note></l>
<l>He saw the red Hibiscus glow,</l>

<l>The glory of her clusters o'er</l>
<l>Tall trees that loads of blossom bore.</l>
<l>Some, elephants had prostrate laid,</l>
<l>In some the monkeys leapt and played,</l>
<l>And through the whole wide forest rang</l>
<l>The charm of gay birds as they sang.</l>
<l>Then Ráma of the lotus eye</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ turned who followed nigh,</l>
<l>And thus the hero youth impressed</l>
<l>With Fortune's favouring signs, addressed:</l>

<l>That balms the pain of weary feet.</l>
<l>Where white clouds rise from flames beneath,</l>

<l>Where silvan things, made gentle, throng,</l>
<l>And every bird is loud in song.</l>
<l>With ruth for suffering creatures filled,</l>

<l>And gave this southern realm to be</l>
<l>A refuge, from oppression free.</l>
<l>There stands his home, whose dreaded might</l>

<l>A glorious task has she assayed,</l>

<l>No pity then her heart can feel,</l>
<l>She arms her soul with warrior's steel,</l>

<l>The hermits who on thee depend.</l>
<l>Now yonder, Prince, direct thine eyes</l>
<l>Where dense Madhúka<note place="foot">The Madhúka, or, as it is now called,

the right reading here, but that it occurs again in verse 29, where it is in like

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: the conquering Lakshmaṇ heard,</l>
<l>Obedient to his brother's word.</l>
<l>Raised by his toil a cottage stood</l>
<l>To shelter Ráma in the wood,</l>
<l>Of ample size, with leaves o'erlaid,</l>
<l>Of hardened earth the walls were made.</l>
<l>The strong bamboos his hands had felled</l>
<l>For pillars fair the roof upheld,</l>
<l>And rafter, beam, and lath supplied</l>
<l>Well interwrought from side to side.</l>
<l>Then Śamí<note place="foot">Acacia Suma.</note> boughs he deftly spread</l>
<l>Enlaced with knotted cord o'erhead,</l>
<l>Well thatched above from ridge to eaves</l>
<l>With holy grass, and reed, and leaves.</l>
<l>The mighty chief with careful toil</l>
<l>Had cleared the ground and smoothed the soil</l>
<pb n="248"/><anchor id="Pg248"/>
<l>Where now, his loving labour done,</l>
<l>Rose a fair home for Raghu's son.</l>
<l>Then when his work was duly wrought,</l>
<l>Godávarís sweet stream he sought,</l>
<l>Bathed, plucked the lilies, and a store</l>
<l>Of fruit and berries homeward bore.</l>
<l>Then sacrifice he duly paid,</l>
<l>And wooed the Gods their hopes to aid,</l>
<l>And then to Ráma proudly showed</l>
<l>The cot prepared for his abode.</l>
<l>Then Raghu's son with Sítá gazed</l>
<l>Upon the home his hands had raised,</l>
<l>And transport thrilled his bosom through</l>
<l>His leafy hermitage to view.</l>
<l>The glorious son of Raghu round</l>
<l>His brother's neck his arms enwound,</l>
<l>And thus began his sweet address</l>
<l>Of deep-felt joy and gentleness:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Well pleased am I, dear lord, to see</q></l>
<l>This noble work performed by thee.</l>
<l>For this,—sole grace I can bestow,—</l>
<l>About thy neck mine arms I throw.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the prince, who lent a grace</l>
<l>To fortune, pride of Raghu's race;</l>
<l>Then in that spot whose pleasant shade</l>
<l>Gave store of fruit, content he stayed.</l>
<l>With Lakshmaṇ and his Maithil spouse</l>
<l>He spent his day's neath sheltering boughs,</l>
<l>As happy as a God on high</l>
<l>Lives in his mansion in the sky.</l>

<lg>
<l>While there the high-souled hero spent</l>
<l>His tranquil hours in sweet content,</l>
<l>The glowing autumn passed, and then</l>
<l>Came winter so beloved of men.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One morn, to bathe, at break of day</l>
<l>To the fair stream he took his way.</l>
<l>Behind him, with the Maithil dame</l>
<l>Bearing a pitcher Lakshmaṇ came,</l>
<l>And as he went the mighty man</l>
<l>Thus to his brother chief began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">The time is come, to thee more dear</q></l>
<l>Than all the months that mark the year:</l>
<l>The gracious seasons' joy and pride,</l>
<l>By which the rest are glorified.</l>
<l>A robe of hoary rime is spread</l>
<l>O'er earth, with corn engarlanded.</l>
<l>The streams we loved no longer please,</l>
<l>But near the fire we take our ease.</l>
<l>Now pious men to God and shade</l>
<l>Offer young corn's fresh sprouted blade,</l>
<l>And purge away their sins with rice</l>
<l>Bestowed in humble sacrifice.</l>
<l>Rich stores of milk delight the swain,</l>
<l>And hearts are cheered that longed for gain,</l>
<l>Proud kings whose breasts for conquests glow</l>
<l>Lead bannered troops to smite the foe.</l>
<l>Dark is the north: the Lord of Day</l>
<l>To Yáma's south<note place="foot">The south is supposed to be the residence
of the departed.</note> has turned away:</l>
<l>And she—sad widow—shines no more,</l>
<l>Reft of the bridal mark<note place="foot">The sun.</note> she wore.</l>
<l>Himálaya's hill, ordained of old</l>
<l>The treasure-house of frost and cold,</l>
<l>Scarce conscious of the feebler glow,</l>
<l>Is truly now the Lord of Snow.</l>
<l>Warmed by the noontide's genial rays</l>
<l>Delightful are the glorious days:</l>
<l>But how we shudder at the chill</l>
<l>Of evening shadows and the rill!</l>
<l>How weak the sun, how cold the breeze!</l>
<l>How white the rime on grass and trees!</l>
<l>The leaves are sere, the woods have lost</l>
<l>Their blossoms killed by nipping frost.</l>
<l>Neath open skies we sleep no more:</l>
<l>December's nights with rime are hoar:</l>
<l>Their triple watch<note place="foot">The night is divided into three watches
of four hours each.</note> in length extends</l>
<l>With hours the shortened daylight lends.</l>
<l>No more the moon's sun-borrowed rays</l>
<l>Are bright, involved in misty haze,</l>
<l>As when upon the mirror's sheen</l>
<l>The breath's obscuring cloud is seen.</l>
<l>E'en at the full the faint beams fail</l>
<l>To struggle through the darksome veil:</l>
<l>Changed like her hue, they want the grace</l>
<l>That parts not yet from Sítá's face.</l>
<l>Cold is the western wind, but how</l>
<l>Its piercing chill is heightened now,</l>
<l>Blowing at early morning twice</l>
<l>As furious with its breath of ice!</l>
<l>See how the dewy tears they weep</l>
<l>The barley, wheat, and woodland steep,</l>
<l>Where, as the sun goes up the sky,</l>
<l>The curlew and the sáras cry.</l>
<l>See where the rice plants scarce uphold</l>
<l>Their full ears tinged with paly gold,</l>
<l>Bending their ripe heads slowly down</l>
<l>Fair as the date tree's flowery crown.</l>
<l>Though now the sun has mounted high</l>
<l>Seeking the forehead of the sky,</l>
<l>Such mist obscures his struggling beams,</l>
<l>No bigger than the moon he seems.</l>
<l>Though weak at first, his rays at length</l>
<l>Grow pleasant in their noonday strength,</l>
<l>And where a while they chance to fall</l>
<l>Fling a faint splendour over all.</l>
<pb n="249"/><anchor id="Pg249"/>
<l>See, o'er the woods where grass is wet</l>
<l>With hoary drops that cling there yet,</l>
<l>With soft light clothing earth and bough</l>
<l>There steals a tender glory now.</l>
<l>Yon elephant who longs to drink,</l>
<l>Still standing on the river's brink,</l>
<l>Plucks back his trunk in shivering haste</l>
<l>From the cold wave he fain would taste.</l>
<l>The very fowl that haunt the mere</l>
<l>Stand doubtful on the bank, and fear</l>
<l>To dip them in the wintry wave</l>
<l>As cowards dread to meet the brave.</l>
<l>The frost of night, the rime of dawn</l>
<l>Bind flowerless trees and glades of lawn:</l>
<l>Benumbed in apathetic chill</l>
<l>Of icy chains they slumber still.</l>
<l>You hear the hidden sáras cry</l>
<l>From floods that wrapped in vapour lie,</l>
<l>And frosty-shining sands reveal</l>
<l>Where the unnoticed rivers steal.</l>
<l>The hoary rime of dewy night,</l>
<l>And suns that glow with tempered light</l>
<l>Lend fresh cool flavours to the rill</l>
<l>That sparkles from the topmost hill.</l>
<l>The cold has killed the lily's pride:</l>
<l>Leaf, filament, and flower have died:</l>
<l>With chilling breath rude winds have blown,</l>
<l>The withered stalk is left alone.</l>
<l>At this gay time, O noblest chief,</l>
<l>The faithful Bharat, worn by grief,</l>
<l>Lives in the royal town where he</l>
<l>Spends weary hours for love of thee.</l>
<l>From titles, honour, kingly sway,</l>
<l>From every joy he turns away:</l>
<l>Couched on cold earth, his days are passed</l>
<l>With scanty fare and hermit's fast.</l>
<l>This moment from his humble bed</l>
<l>He lifts, perhaps, his weary head,</l>
<l>And girt by many a follower goes</l>
<l>To bathe where silver Sarjú flows.</l>
<l>How, when the frosty morn is dim,</l>
<l>Shall Sarjú be a bath for him</l>
<l>Nursed with all love and tender care,</l>
<l>So delicate and young and fair.</l>
<l>How bright his hue! his brilliant eye</l>
<l>With the broad lotus leaf may vie.</l>
<l>By fortune stamped for happy fate,</l>
<l>His graceful form is tall and straight.</l>
<l>In duty skilled, his words are truth:</l>
<l>He proudly rules each lust of youth.</l>
<l>Though his strong arm smites down the foe,</l>
<l>In gentle speech his accents flow.</l>
<l>Yet every joy has he resigned</l>
<l>And cleaves to thee with heart and mind.</l>
<l>Thus by the deeds that he has done</l>
<l>A name in heaven has Bharat won,</l>
<l>For in his life he follows yet</l>
<l>Thy steps, O banished anchoret.</l>
<l>Thus faithful Bharat, nobly wise,</l>
<l>The proverb of the world belies:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">No men, by mothers' guidance led,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The footsteps of their fathers tread.</q></l>
<l>How could Kaikeyí, blest to be</l>
<l>Spouse of the king our sire, and see</l>
<l>A son like virtuous Bharat, blot</l>
<l><q rend="post">Her glory with so foul a plot!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in fraternal love he spoke,</l>
<l>And from his lips reproaches broke:</l>
<l>But Ráma grieved to hear him chide</l>
<l>The absent mother, and replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Cease, O beloved, cease to blame</q></l>
<l>Our royal father's second dame.</l>
<l>Still speak of Bharat first in place</l>
<l>Of old Ikshváku's princely race.</l>
<l>My heart, so firmly bent but now</l>
<l>To dwell in woods and keep my vow,</l>
<l>Half melting as I hear thee speak</l>
<l>Of Bharat's love, grows soft and weak,</l>
<l>With tender joy I bring to mind</l>
<l>His speeches ever sweet and kind.</l>
<l>That dear as Amrit took the sense</l>
<l>With most enchanting influence.</l>
<l>Ah, when shall I, no more to part,</l>
<l>Meet Bharat of the mighty heart?</l>
<l>When, O my brother, when shall we</l>
<l><q rend="post">The good and brave Śatrughna see?</q></l>
<l>Thus as he poured his fond lament</l>
<l>The son of Raghu onward went:</l>
<l>They reached the river, and the three</l>
<l>Bathed them in fair Godávarí.</l>
<l>Libations of the stream they paid</l>
<l>To every deity and shade,</l>
<l>With hymns of praise, the Sun on high</l>
<l>And sinless Gods to glorify.</l>
<l>Fresh from the purifying tide</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resplendent Ráma came,</l>

<l>With Lakshmaṇ there he sat and told</l>
<l>Sweet stories of the days of old,</l>

<l>With heart upon each tale intent,</l>
<l>A giantess, by fancy led,</l>
<l>Came wandering to his leafy shed.</l>
<l>Fierce Śúrpaṇakhá,—her of yore</l>
<l>The Ten-necked tyrant's mother bore,—</l>
<l>Saw Ráma with his noble mien</l>
<l>Bright as the Gods in heaven are seen;</l>
<l>Him from whose brow a glory gleamed,</l>
<l>Like lotus leaves his full eyes beamed:</l>
<l>Long-armed, of elephantine gait,</l>
<l>With hair close coiled in hermit plait:</l>
<l>In youthful vigour, nobly framed,</l>
<l>By glorious marks a king proclaimed:</l>
<l>Like some bright lotus lustrous-hued,</l>
<l>With young Kandarpa's<note place="foot">The God of love.</note> grace endued:</l>
<l>As there like Indra's self he shone,</l>
<l>She loved the youth she gazed upon.</l>
<l>She grim of eye and foul of face</l>
<l>Loved his sweet glance and forehead's grace:</l>
<l>She of unlovely figure, him</l>
<l>Of stately form and shapely limb:</l>
<l>She whose dim locks disordered hung,</l>
<l>Him whose bright hair on high brows clung:</l>
<l>She whose fierce accents counselled fear,</l>
<l>Him whose soft tones were sweet to hear:</l>
<l>She whose dire form with age was dried,</l>
<l>Him radiant in his youthful pride:</l>
<l>She whose false lips maintained the wrong,</l>
<l>Him in the words of virtue strong:</l>
<l>She cruel-hearted, stained with sin,</l>
<l>Him just in deed and pure within.</l>
<l>She, hideous fiend, a thing to hate,</l>
<l>Him formed each eye to captivate:</l>
<l>Fierce passion in her bosom woke,</l>
<l>And thus to Raghu's son she spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">With matted hair above thy brows,</q></l>
<l>With bow and shaft and this thy spouse,</l>

<l>The giant-haunted wilderness?</l>
<l>What dost thou here? The cause explain:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Why art thou come, and what to gain?</q></l>
<l>As Śúrpaṇakhá questioned so,</l>
<l>Ráma, the terror of the foe,</l>
<l>In answer to the monster's call,</l>
<l>With fearless candour told her all.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">King Daśaratha reigned of old,</q></l>
<l>Like Gods celestial brave and bold.</l>
<l>I am his eldest son and heir,</l>
<l>And Ráma is the name I bear.</l>
<l>This brother, Lakshmaṇ, younger born,</l>
<l>Most faithful love to me has sworn.</l>
<l>My wife, this princess, dear to fame,</l>
<l>Is Sitá the Videhan dame.</l>
<l>Obedient to my sire's behest</l>
<l>And by the queen my mother pressed,</l>
<l>To keep the law and merit win,</l>
<l>I sought this wood to harbour in.</l>
<l>But speak, for I of thee in turn</l>
<l>Thy name, and race, and sire would learn.</l>
<l>Thou art of giant race, I ween.</l>

<l>Dúshaṇ and Khara, brave and bold</l>
<l>Whose fame by every tongue is told:</l>
<l>Their might by mine is far surpassed;</l>
<l>But when, O best of men, I cast</l>
<l>These fond eyes on thy form, I see</l>
<l>My chosen love and lord in thee.</l>
<l>Endowed with wondrous might am I:</l>
<l>Where'er my fancy leads I fly.</l>
<l>The poor misshapen Sítá leave,</l>
<l>And me, thy worthier bride receive.</l>
<l>Look on my beauty, and prefer</l>
<l>A spouse more meet than one like her:</l>
<l>I'll eat that ill-formed woman there:</l>

<l>With winning looks, most nobly bred,</l>

</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero spoke, the monster heard,</l>

<l>Away from Ráma's side she broke,</l>
<l>And thus in turn to Lakshmaṇ spoke:</l>

<l>In fairest grace that suits with thine.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Lakshmaṇ, skilled in soft address,</l>
<l>Wooed by the amorous giantess,</l>
<l>With art to turn her love aside,</l>
<l>To Śúrpaṇakhá thus replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">And can so high a dame agree</q></l>
<l>The slave-wife of a slave to be?</l>
<l>I, lotus-hued! in good and ill</l>

<l>Be thou, fair creature radiant-eyed,</l>
<l>My honoured brother's younger bride:</l>
<l>With faultless tint and dainty limb,</l>
<l>A happy wife, bring joy to him.</l>
<l>He from his spouse grown old and grey,</l>

<l><q rend="post">Thy beauties rich in all delight?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Lakshmaṇ praised in scornful jest</l>
<l>The long-toothed fiend with loathly breast,</l>
<l>Who fondly heard his speech, nor knew</l>
<l>His mocking words were aught but true.</l>
<l>Again inflamed with love she fled</l>

<l>But as the furious fiend drew near,</l>
<l>Like Death's dire noose which chills with fear,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: then Lakshmaṇ's wrath rose high,</l>
<l>And there before his brother's eye,</l>
<l>He drew that sword which none could stay,</l>

<l>Deformed, terrific, huge, and dread,</l>

<head>Canto XIX. The Rousing Of Khara.</head>

<lg>
<l>When Khara saw his sister lie</l>
<l>With blood-stained limbs and troubled eye,</l>
<pb n="252"/><anchor id="Pg252"/>
<l>Wild fury in his bosom woke,</l>
<l>And thus the monstrous giant spoke;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Arise, my sister; cast away</q></l>
<l>This numbing terror and dismay,</l>
<l>And straight the impious hand declare</l>
<l>That marred those features once so fair.</l>
<l>For who his finger tip will lay</l>
<l>On the black snake in childish play,</l>
<l>And unattacked, with idle stroke</l>
<l>His poison-laden fang provoke?</l>
<l>Ill-fated fool, he little knows</l>
<l>Death's noose around his neck he throws,</l>
<l>Who rashly met thee, and a draught</l>
<l>Of life-destroying poison quaffed.</l>
<l>Strong, fierce as death, 'twas thine to choose</l>
<l>Thy way at will, each shape to use;</l>
<l>In power and might like one of us:</l>
<l>What hand has maimed and marred thee thus?</l>
<l>What God or fiend this deed has wrought,</l>
<l>What bard or sage of lofty thought</l>
<l>Was armed with power supremely great</l>
<l>Thy form to mar and mutilate?</l>
<l>In all the worlds not one I see</l>
<l>Would dare a deed to anger me:</l>
<l>Not Indra's self, the Thousand-eyed,</l>
<l>Beneath whose hand fierce Páka<note place="foot">A demon slain by Indra.</note>
died.</l>
<l>My life-destroying darts this day</l>
<l>His guilty breath shall rend away,</l>
<l>E'en as the thirsty wild swan drains</l>
<l>Each milk-drop that the wave retains.</l>
<l>Whose blood in foaming streams shall burst</l>
<l>O'er the dry ground which lies athirst,</l>
<l>When by my shafts transfixed and slain</l>
<l>He falls upon the battle plain?</l>
<l>From whose dead corpse shall birds of air</l>
<l>The mangled flesh and sinews tear,</l>
<l>And in their gory feast delight,</l>
<l>When I have slain him in the fight?</l>
<l>Not God or bard or wandering ghost,</l>
<l>No giant of our mighty host</l>
<l>Shall step between us, or avail</l>
<l>To save the wretch when I assail.</l>
<l>Collect each scattered sense, recall</l>
<l>Thy troubled thoughts, and tell me all.</l>
<l>What wretch attacked thee in the way,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And quelled thee in victorious fray?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His breast with burning fury fired,</l>
<l>Thus Khara of the fiend inquired:</l>
<l>And then with many a tear and sigh</l>
<l>Thus Śúrpaṇakhá made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">'Tis Daśaratha's sons, a pair</q></l>
<l>Strong, resolute, and young, and fair:</l>
<l>In coats of dark and blackdeer's hide,</l>
<l>And like the radiant lotus eyed:</l>
<l>On berries roots and fruit they feed,</l>
<l>And lives of saintly virtue lead:</l>
<l>With ordered senses undefiled,</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ are they styled.</l>
<l>Fair as the Minstrels' King<note place="foot">Chitraratha, King of
the Gandharvas.</note> are they,</l>
<l>And stamped with signs of regal sway.</l>
<l>I know not if the heroes trace</l>
<l>Their line from Gods or Dánav<note place="foot">Titanic.</note> race.</l>
<l>There by these wondering eyes between</l>
<l>The noble youths a dame was seen,</l>
<l>Fair, blooming, young, with dainty waist,</l>
<l>And all her bright apparel graced.</l>
<l>For her with ready heart and mind</l>
<l>The royal pair their strength combined,</l>
<l>And brought me to this last distress,</l>
<l>Like some lost woman, comfortless.</l>
<l>Perfidious wretch! my soul is fain</l>
<l>Her foaming blood and theirs to drain.</l>
<l>O let me head the vengeful fight,</l>
<l>And with this hand my murderers smite.</l>
<l>Come, brother, hasten to fulfil</l>
<l>This longing of my eager will.</l>
<l>On to the battle! Let me drink</l>
<l><q rend="post">Their lifeblood as to earth they sink.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Khara, by his sister pressed,</l>
<l>Inflamed with fury, gave his hest</l>
<l>To twice seven giants of his crew,</l>
<l>Fierce as the God of death to view:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Two men equipped with arms, who wear</l>
<l>Deerskin and bark and matted hair,</l>
<l>Leading a beauteous dame, have strayed</l>
<l>To the wild gloom of Daṇḍak's shade.</l>
<l>These men, this cursed woman slay,</l>
<l>And hasten back without delay,</l>
<l>That this my sister's lips may be</l>
<l>Red with the lifeblood of the three.</l>
<l>Giants, my wounded sister longs</l>
<l>To take this vengeance for her wrongs.</l>
<l>With speed her dearest wish fulfil,</l>
<l>And with your might these creatures kill.</l>
<l>Soon as your matchless strength shall lay</l>
<l>These brothers dead in battle fray,</l>
<l>She in triumphant joy will laugh,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And their hearts' blood delighted quaff.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The giants heard the words he said,</l>
<l>And forth with Śúrpaṇakhá sped,</l>
<l>As mighty clouds in autumn fly</l>
<l>Urged by the wind along the sky.</l>

<lg>
<l>Fierce Śúrpaṇakhá with her train</l>
<l>To Ráma's dwelling came again,</l>
<l>And to the eager giants showed</l>
<l>Where Sítá and the youths abode.</l>
<l>Within the leafy cot they spied</l>
<l>The hero by his consort's side,</l>
<l>And faithful Lakshmaṇ ready still</l>
<l>To wait upon his brother's will.</l>
<pb n="253"/><anchor id="Pg253"/>
<l>Then noble Ráma raised his eye</l>
<l>And saw the giants standing nigh,</l>
<l>And then, as nearer still they pressed.</l>
<l>His glorious brother thus addressed,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Be thine a while, my brother dear,</q></l>
<l>To watch o'er Sítá's safety here,</l>
<l>And I will slay these creatures who</l>
<l><q rend="post">The footsteps of my spouse pursue.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and reverent Lakshmaṇ heard</l>
<l>Submissive to his brother's word.</l>
<l>The son of Raghu, virtuous-souled,</l>
<l>Strung his great bow adorned with gold,</l>
<l>And, with the weapon in his hand,</l>
<l>Addressed him to the giant band:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ráma and Lakshmaṇ we, who spring</q></l>
<l>From Daśaratha, mighty king;</l>
<l>We dwell a while with Sítá here</l>
<l>In Daṇḍak forest wild and drear.</l>
<l>On woodland roots and fruit we feed,</l>
<l>And lives of strictest rule we lead.</l>
<l>Say why would ye our lives oppress</l>
<l>Who sojourn in the wilderness.</l>
<l>Sent hither by the hermits' prayer</l>
<l>With bow and darts unused to spare,</l>
<l>For vengeance am I come to slay</l>
<l>Your sinful band in battle fray.</l>
<l>Rest as ye are: remain content,</l>
<l>Nor try the battle's dire event.</l>
<l>Unless your offered lives ye spurn,</l>
<l><q rend="post">O rovers of the night, return.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They listened while the hero spoke,</l>
<l>And fury in each breast awoke.</l>
<l>The Bráhman-slayers raised on high</l>
<l>Their mighty spears and made reply:</l>
<l>They spoke with eyes aglow with ire,</l>
<l>While Ráma's burnt with vengeful tire,</l>
<l>And answered thus, in fury wild,</l>
<l>That peerless chief whose tones were mild:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Nay thou hast angered, overbold,</q></l>
<l>Khara our lord, the mighty-souled,</l>
<l>And for thy sin, in battle strife</l>
<l>Shalt yield to us thy forfeit life.</l>
<l>No power hast thou alone to stand</l>
<l>Against the numbers of our band.</l>
<l>'Twere vain to match thy single might</l>
<l>Against us in the front of fight.</l>
<l>When we equipped for fight advance</l>
<l>With brandished pike and mace and lance,</l>
<l>Thou, vanquished in the desperate field,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thy bow, thy strength, thy life shalt yield.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With bitter words and threatening mien</l>
<l>Thus furious spoke the fierce fourteen,</l>
<l>And raising scimitar and spear</l>
<l>On Ráma rushed in wild career.</l>
<l>Their levelled spears the giant crew</l>
<l>Against the matchless hero threw.</l>
<l>His bow the son of Raghu bent,</l>
<l>And twice seven shafts to meet them sent,</l>
<l>And every javelin sundered fell</l>
<l>By the bright darts he aimed so well.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero saw: his anger grew</l>
<l>To fury: from his side he drew</l>
<l>Fresh sunbright arrows pointed keen,</l>
<l>In number, like his foes, fourteen.</l>
<l>His bow he grasped, the string he drew,</l>
<l>And gazing on the giant crew,</l>
<l>As Indra casts the levin, so</l>
<l>Shot forth his arrows at the foe.</l>
<l>The hurtling arrows, stained with gore,</l>
<l>Through the fiends' breasts a passage tore,</l>
<l>And in the earth lay buried deep</l>
<l>As serpents through an ant-hill creep</l>
<l>Like trees uptorn by stormy blast</l>
<l>The shattered fiends to earth were cast,</l>
<l>And there with mangled bodies they,</l>
<l>Bathed in their blood and breathless, lay.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fainting heart and furious eye</l>
<l>The demon saw her champions die.</l>
<l>With drying wounds that scarcely bled</l>
<l>Back to her brother's home she fled.</l>
<l>Oppressed with pain, with loud lament</l>
<l>At Khara's feet the monster bent.</l>
<l>There like a plant whence slowly come</l>
<l>The trickling drops of oozy gum,</l>
<l>With her grim features pale with pain</l>
<l>She poured her tears in ceaseless rain,</l>

<lg>
<l>Low in the dust he saw her lie,</l>
<l>And Khara's wrath grew fierce and high.</l>
<l>Aloud he cried to her who came</l>
<l>Disgracefully with baffled aim:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I sent with thee at thy request</q></l>
<l>The bravest of my giants, best</l>
<l>Of all who feed upon the slain:</l>
<l>Why art thou weeping here again?</l>
<l>Still to their master's interest true,</l>
<l>My faithful, noble, loyal crew,</l>
<l>Though slaughtered in the bloody fray,</l>
<l>Would yet their monarch's word obey.</l>
<l>Now I, my sister, fain would know</l>
<l>The cause of this thy fear and woe,</l>
<l>Why like a snake thou writhest there,</l>
<l>Calling for aid in wild despair.</l>
<l>Nay, lie not thus in lowly guise:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Cast off thy weakness and arise!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With soothing words the giant chief</l>
<l>Assuaged the fury of her grief.</l>
<l>Her weeping eyes she slowly dried</l>
<l>And to her brother thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I sought thee in my shame and fear</q></l>
<l>With severed nose and mangled ear:</l>
<l>My gashes like a river bled,</l>
<l>I sought thee and was comforted.</l>
<pb n="254"/><anchor id="Pg254"/>
<l>Those twice seven giants, brave and strong,</l>
<l>Thou sentest to avenge the wrong,</l>
<l>To lay the savage Ráma low,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ who misused me so.</l>
<l>But ah, the shafts of Ráma through</l>
<l>The bodies of my champions flew:</l>
<l>Though madly fierce their spears they plied,</l>
<l>Beneath his conquering might they died.</l>
<l>I saw them, famed for strength and speed,</l>
<l>I saw my heroes fall and bleed:</l>
<l>Great trembling seized my every limb</l>
<l>At the great deed achieved by him.</l>
<l>In trouble, horror, doubt, and dread,</l>
<l>Again to thee for help I fled.</l>
<l>While terror haunts my troubled sight,</l>
<l>I seek thee, rover of the night.</l>
<l>And canst thou not thy sister free</l>
<l>From this wide waste of troublous sea</l>
<l>Whose sharks are doubt and terror, where</l>
<l>Each wreathing wave is dark despair?</l>
<l>Low lie on earth thy giant train</l>
<l>By ruthless Ráma's arrows slain,</l>
<l>And all the mighty demons, fed</l>
<l>On blood, who followed me are dead.</l>
<l>Now if within thy breast may be</l>
<l>Pity for them and love for me,</l>
<l>If thou, O rover of the night,</l>
<l>Have valour and with him can fight,</l>
<l>Subdue the giants' cruel foe</l>
<l>Who dwells where Daṇḍak's thickets grow.</l>
<l>But if thine arm in vain assay</l>
<l>This queller of his foes to slay,</l>
<l>Now surely here before thine eyes,</l>
<l>Wronged and ashamed thy sister dies.</l>
<l>Too well, alas, too well I see</l>
<l>That, strong in war as thou mayst be,</l>
<l>Thou canst not in the battle stand</l>
<l>When Ráma meets thee hand to hand.</l>
<l>Go forth, thou hero but in name,</l>
<l>Assuming might thou canst not claim;</l>
<l>Call friend and kin, no longer stay:</l>
<l>Away from Janasthán, away!</l>
<l>Shame of thy race! the weak alone</l>
<l>Beneath thine arm may sink o'erthrown:</l>
<l>Fly Ráma and his brother: they</l>
<l>Are men too strong for thee to slay.</l>
<l>How canst thou hope, O weak and base,</l>
<l>To make this grove thy dwelling-place?</l>
<l>With Ráma's might unmeet to vie,</l>
<l>O'ermastered thou wilt quickly die.</l>

<l>Roused by the taunting words she spoke,</l>

<l>And there, while giants girt him round,</l>
<l>In these fierce words an utterance found:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">I cannot, peerless one, contain</q></l>

<l>First moved to ire by taunts and stings,</l>
<l>Now soothed by gentle flatterings,</l>
<l>To Dúshaṇ, who his armies led,</l>

<l>As forth upon its errand went</l>
<l>That huge ferocious armament,</l>

<l>With threatening thunders from its womb</l>
<l>Poured in sad augury a flood</l>
<l>Of rushing water mixt with blood.</l>
<l>The monarch's steeds, though strong and fleet,</l>
<l>Stumbled and fell: and yet their feet</l>
<l>Passed o'er the bed of flowers that lay</l>
<l>Fresh gathered on the royal way.</l>
<l>No gleam of sunlight struggled through</l>
<l>The sombre pall of midnight hue,</l>
<l>Edged with a line of bloody red,</l>
<l>Like whirling torches overhead.</l>
<l>A vulture, fierce, of mighty size.</l>
<l>Terrific with his cruel eyes,</l>
<l>Perched on the staff enriched with gold,</l>
<l>Whence hung the flag in many a fold.</l>
<l>Each ravening bird, each beast of prey</l>
<l>Where Janasthán's wild thickets lay,</l>
<l>Rose with a long discordant cry</l>
<l>And gathered as the host went by.</l>
<l>And from the south long, wild, and shrill,</l>

<l>Like elephants in frantic mood,</l>
<l>Vast clouds terrific, sable-hued,</l>
<l>Hid all the sky where'er they bore</l>
<l>Their load of water mixt with gore.</l>
<l>Above, below, around were spread</l>
<l>Thick shades of darkness strange and dread,</l>
<l>Nor could the wildered glance descry</l>
<l>A point or quarter of the sky.</l>
<l>Then came o'er heaven a sanguine hue,</l>
<l>Though evening's flush not yet was due,</l>
<l>While each ill-omened bird that flies</l>
<l>Assailed the king with harshest cries.</l>
<l>There screamed the vulture and the crane,</l>
<l>And the loud jackal shrieked again.</l>
<l>Each hideous thing that bodes aright</l>
<l>Disaster in the coming fight,</l>
<l>With gaping mouth that hissed and flamed,</l>
<l>The ruin of the host proclaimed.</l>
<l>Eclipse untimely reft away</l>
<l>The brightness of the Lord of Day,</l>
<l>And near his side was seen to glow</l>

<l>And stars like fireflies shed their light,</l>

<l>Each awful sign the giant viewed,</l>

<l>Care on his brow sat chill and black,</l>

<l>Upon each fearful sight that raised</l>

<lg>
<l>While Khara, urged by valiant rage,</l>
<l>Drew near that little hermitage,</l>
<l>Those wondrous signs in earth and sky</l>
<l>Smote on each prince's watchful eye.</l>
<l>When Ráma saw those signs of woe</l>
<l>Fraught with destruction to the foe,</l>
<l>With bold impatience scarce repressed</l>
<l>His brother chief he thus addressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">These fearful signs, my brother bold,</q></l>
<l>Which threaten all our foes, behold:</l>
<l>All laden, as they strike the view,</l>
<l>With ruin to the fiendish crew.</l>
<l>The angry clouds are gathering fast,</l>
<l>Their skirts with dusty gloom o'ercast,</l>
<l>And harsh with loud-voiced thunder, rain</l>
<l>Thick drops of blood upon the plain.</l>
<l>See, burning for the coming fight,</l>
<l>My shafts with wreaths of smoke are white,</l>
<l>And my great bow embossed with gold</l>
<l>Throbs eager for the master's hold.</l>
<l>Each bird that through the forest flies</l>
<l>Sends out its melancholy cries.</l>
<l>All signs foretell the dangerous strife,</l>
<l>The jeopardy of limb and life.</l>
<l>Each sight, each sound gives warning clear</l>
<l>That foemen meet and death is near.</l>
<l>But courage, valiant brother! well</l>
<l>The throbbings of mine arm foretell</l>
<l>That ruin waits the hostile powers,</l>
<l>And triumph in the fight is ours.</l>
<l>I hail the welcome omen: thou</l>
<l>Art bright of face and clear of brow.</l>
<l>For Lakshmaṇ, when the eye can trace</l>
<l>A cloud upon the warrior's face</l>
<l>Stealing the cheerful light away,</l>
<l>His life is doomed in battle fray.</l>
<l>List, brother, to that awful cry:</l>
<l>With shout and roar the fiends draw nigh.</l>
<l>With thundering beat of many a drum</l>
<l>The savage-hearted giants come.</l>
<l>The wise who value safety know</l>
<l>To meet, prepared, the coming blow:</l>
<l>In paths of prudence trained aright</l>
<l>They watch the stroke before it smite.</l>
<l>Take thou thine arrows and thy bow,</l>
<l>And with the Maithil lady go</l>
<l>For shelter to the mountain cave</l>
<l>Where thickest trees their branches wave.</l>
<l>I will not have thee, Lakshmaṇ, say</l>
<l>One word in answer, but obey.</l>
<l>By all thy honour for these feet</l>
<l>Of mine, dear brother, I entreat.</l>
<l>Thy warlike arm, I know could, smite</l>
<l>To death these rovers of the night;</l>
<l>But I this day would fight alone</l>
<l><q rend="post">Till all the fiends be overthrown.</q></l>

<l>He spake: and Lakshmaṇ answered naught:</l>
<l>His arrows and his bow he brought,</l>
<l>And then with Sítá following hied</l>
<l>For shelter to the mountain side.</l>
<l>As Lakshmaṇ and the lady through</l>
<l>The forest to the cave withdrew,</l>
<l><q>'Tis well,</q> cried Ráma. Then he braced</l>
<l>His coat of mail around his waist.</l>
<l>When, bright as blazing fire, upon</l>
<l>His mighty limbs that armour shone,</l>
<l>The hero stood like some great light</l>
<l>Uprising in the dark of night.</l>
<l>His dreadful shafts were by his side;</l>
<l>His trusty bow he bent and plied,</l>

<l>Each saint divine of loftiest thought,</l>

<l>They saw the giants' armament,</l>
<l>And Ráma clothed in warrior might,</l>
<l>Forth standing in the front of fight.</l>
<l>Lord of the arm no toil might tire,</l>
<l>He stood majestic in his ire,</l>
<l>Matchless in form as Rudra<note place="foot">Śiva.</note> when</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Gods and saints in close array</l>

<l>Long, loud and deep their war-cry pealed,</l>
<l>As on they rushed with flag and shield,</l>
<l>Each, of his proper valour proud,</l>

<l>He drew his arrows forth, and reared</l>

<lg>
<l>When Khara with the hosts he led</l>
<l>Drew near to Ráma's leafy shed,</l>
<l>He saw that queller of the foe</l>
<l>Stand ready with his ordered bow.</l>
<l>He saw, and burning at the view</l>
<l>His clanging bow he raised and drew,</l>
<l>And bade his driver urge apace</l>
<l>His car to meet him face to face.</l>
<l>Obedient to his master's hest</l>
<l>His eager steeds the driver pressed</l>
<l>On to the spot where, none to aid,</l>
<l>The strong-armed chief his weapon swayed.</l>
<l>Soon as the children of the night</l>
<l>Saw Khara rushing to the fight,</l>
<pb n="258"/><anchor id="Pg258"/>
<l>His lords with loud unearthly cry</l>
<l>Followed their chief and gathered nigh.</l>
<l>As in his car the leader rode</l>
<l>With all his lords around, he showed</l>
<l>Like the red planet fiery Mars</l>
<l>Surrounded by the lesser stars.</l>
<l>Then with a horrid yell that rent</l>
<l>The air, the giant chieftain sent</l>
<l>A thousand darts in rapid shower</l>
<l>On Ráma matchless in his power.</l>
<l>The rovers of the night, impelled</l>
<l>By fiery rage which naught withheld,</l>
<l>Upon the unconquered prince, who strained</l>
<l>His fearful bow, their arrows rained.</l>
<l>With sword and club, with mace and pike,</l>
<l>With spear and axe to pierce and strike,</l>
<l>Those furious fiends on every side</l>
<l>The unconquerable hero plied.</l>
<l>The giant legions huge and strong,</l>
<l>Like clouds the tempest drives along,</l>
<l>Rushed upon Ráma with the speed</l>
<l>Of whirling car, and mounted steed,</l>
<l>And hill-like elephant, to slay</l>
<l>The matchless prince in battle fray.</l>
<l>Then upon Ráma thick and fast</l>
<l>The rain of mortal steel they cast,</l>
<l>As labouring clouds their torrents shed</l>
<l>Upon the mountain-monarch's<note place="foot">Himálaya.</note> head.</l>
<l>As near and nearer round him drew</l>
<l>The warriors of the giant crew,</l>
<l>He showed like Śiva girt by all</l>
<l>His spirits when night's shadows fall.</l>
<l>As the great deep receives each rill</l>
<l>And river rushing from the hill,</l>
<l>He bore that flood of darts, and broke</l>
<l>With well-aimed shaft each murderous stroke.</l>
<l>By stress of arrowy storm assailed,</l>
<l>And wounded sore, he never failed,</l>
<l>Like some high mountain which defies</l>
<l>The red bolts flashing from the skies.</l>
<l>With ruddy streams each limb was dyed</l>
<l>From gaping wounds in breast and side,</l>
<l>Showing the hero like the sun</l>
<l>'Mid crimson clouds ere day is done.</l>
<l>Then, at that sight of terror, faint</l>
<l>Grew God, Gandharva, sage, and saint,</l>
<l>Trembling to see the prince oppose</l>
<l>His single might to myriad foes.</l>
<l>But waxing wroth, with force unspent,</l>
<l>He strained his bow to utmost bent,</l>
<l>And forth his arrows keen and true</l>
<l>In hundreds, yea in thousands flew,—</l>
<l>Shafts none could ward, and none endure:</l>
<l>Death's fatal noose was scarce so sure.</l>
<l>As 'twere in playful ease he shot</l>
<l>His gilded shafts, and rested not.</l>
<l>With swiftest flight and truest aim</l>
<l>Upon the giant hosts they came.</l>
<l>Each smote, each stayed a foeman's breath</l>
<l>As fatal as the coil of Death.</l>
<l>Each arrow through a giant tore</l>
<l>A passage, and besmeared with gore,</l>
<l>Pursued its onward way and through</l>
<l>The air with flamy brilliance flew.</l>
<l>Unnumbered were the arrows sent</l>
<l>From the great bow which Ráma bent,</l>
<l>And every shaft with iron head</l>
<l>The lifeblood of a giant shed.</l>
<l>Their pennoned bows were cleft, nor mail</l>
<l>Nor shield of hide could aught avail.</l>
<l>For Ráma's myriad arrows tore</l>
<l>Through arms, and bracelets which they wore,</l>
<l>And severed mighty warriors' thighs</l>
<l>Like trunks of elephants in size,</l>
<l>And cut resistless passage sheer</l>
<l>Through gold-decked horse and charioteer,</l>
<l>Slew elephant and rider, slew</l>
<l>The horseman and the charger too,</l>
<l>And infantry unnumbered sent</l>
<l>To dwell 'neath Yáma's government.</l>
<l>Then rose on high a fearful yell</l>
<l>Of rovers of the night, who fell</l>
<l>Beneath that iron torrent, sore</l>
<l>Wounded by shafts that rent and tore.</l>
<l>So mangled by the ceaseless storm</l>
<l>Of shafts of every kind and form,</l>
<l>Such joy they found, as forests feel</l>
<l>When scorched by flame, from Ráma's steel.</l>
<l>The mightiest still the fight maintained,</l>
<l>And furious upon Ráma rained</l>
<l>Dart, arrow, spear, with wild attacks</l>
<l>Of mace, and club, and battle-axe.</l>
<l>But the great chief, unconquered yet,</l>
<l>Their weapons with his arrows met,</l>
<l>Which severed many a giant's head,</l>
<l>And all the plain with corpses spread.</l>
<l>With sundered bow and shattered shield</l>
<l>Headless they sank upon the field,</l>
<l>As the tall trees, that felt the blast</l>
<l>Of Garuḍ's wing, to earth were cast.</l>
<l>The giants left unslaughtered there</l>
<l>Where filled with terror and despair,</l>
<l>And to their leader Khara fled</l>
<l>Faint, wounded, and discomfited.</l>
<l>These fiery Dúshaṇ strove to cheer,</l>
<l>And poised his bow to calm their fear;</l>
<l>Then fierce as He who rules the dead,</l>
<l>When wroth, on angered Ráma sped.</l>
<l>By Dúshaṇ cheered, the demons cast</l>
<l>Their dread aside and rallied fast</l>
<l>With Sáls, rocks, palm-trees in their hands</l>
<l>With nooses, maces, pikes, and brands,</l>
<l>Again upon the godlike man</l>
<l>The mighty fiends infuriate ran,</l>
<l>These casting rocks like hail, and these</l>
<l>A whelming shower of leafy trees.</l>
<l>Wild, wondrous fight, the eye to scare,</l>
<l>And raise on end each shuddering hair,</l>
<pb n="259"/><anchor id="Pg259"/>
<l>As with the fiends who loved to rove</l>
<l>By night heroic Ráma strove!</l>
<l>The giants in their fury plied</l>
<l>Ráma with darts on every side.</l>
<l>Then, by the gathering demons pressed</l>
<l>From north and south and east and west,</l>
<l>By showers of deadly darts assailed</l>
<l>From every quarter fiercely hailed,</l>
<l>Girt by the foes who swarmed around,</l>
<l>He raised a mighty shout whose sound</l>
<l>Struck terror. On the giant crew</l>
<l>His great Gandharva<note place="foot">One of the mysterious weapons given

<l>A thousand mortal shafts were rained</l>
<l>From the orbed bow the hero strained,</l>
<l>Till east and west and south and north</l>
<l>Were filled with arrows volleyed forth.</l>
<l>They heard the fearful shout: they saw</l>
<l>His mighty hand the bowstring draw,</l>
<l>Yet could no wounded giant's eye</l>
<l>See the swift storm of arrows fly.</l>
<l>Still firm the warrior stood and cast</l>
<l>His deadly missiles thick and fast.</l>
<l>Dark grew the air with arrowy hail</l>
<l>Which hid the sun as with a veil.</l>
<l>Fiends wounded, falling, fallen, slain,</l>
<l>All in a moment, spread the plain,</l>
<l>And thousands scarce alive were left</l>
<l>Mangled, and gashed, and torn, and cleft.</l>
<l>Dire was the sight, the plain o'erspread</l>
<l>With trophies of the mangled dead.</l>
<l>There lay, by Ráma's missiles rent,</l>
<l>Full many a priceless ornament,</l>
<l>With severed limb and broken gem,</l>
<l>Hauberk and helm and diadem.</l>
<l>There lay the shattered car, the steed,</l>
<l>The elephant of noblest breed,</l>
<l>The splintered spear, the shivered mace,</l>
<l>Chouris and screens to shade the face.</l>
<l>The giants saw with bitterest pain</l>
<l>Their warriors weltering on the plain,</l>
<l>Nor dared again his might oppose</l>
<l>Who scourged the cities of his foes.</l>

<lg>
<l>When Dúshaṇ saw his giant band</l>
<l>Slaughtered by Ráma's conquering hand,</l>
<l>He called five thousand fiends, and gave</l>
<l>His orders. Bravest of the brave,</l>
<l>Invincible, of furious might,</l>
<l>Ne'er had they turned their backs in flight.</l>
<l>They, as their leader bade them seize</l>
<l>Spears, swords, and clubs, and rocks, and trees,</l>
<l>Poured on the dauntless prince again</l>
<l>A ceaseless shower of deadly rain.</l>
<l>The virtuous Ráma, undismayed,</l>
<l>Their missiles with his arrows stayed,</l>
<l>And weakened, ere it fell, the shock</l>

<l>And like a bull with eyelids closed,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then blazed his ire: he longed to smite</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the fiend, by rage impelled,</l>

<l>With Śyenagámí and the rest</l>
<l>Of his twelve chiefs he onward pressed,</l>
<l>And every giant as he went</l>
<l>A storm of well-wrought arrows sent.</l>
<l>Then with his pointed shafts that came</l>
<l>With gold and diamond bright as flame,</l>
<l>Dead to the earth the hero threw</l>
<l>The remnant of the demon crew.</l>
<l>Those shafts with feathers bright as gold,</l>
<l>Like flames which wreaths of smoke enfold,</l>
<l>Smote down the fiends like tall trees rent</l>
<l>By red bolts from the firmament.</l>
<l>A hundred shafts he pointed well:</l>
<l>By their keen barbs a hundred fell:</l>
<l>A thousand,—and a thousand more</l>
<l>In battle's front lay drenched in gore.</l>
<l>Of all defence and guard bereft,</l>
<l>With sundered bows and harness cleft.</l>
<l>Their bodies red with bloody stain</l>
<l>Fell the night-rovers on the plain,</l>

<l>Of bleeding giants prostrate there,</l>
<l>Like some great altar showed, arrayed</l>
<l>For holy rites with grass o'erlaid.</l>
<l>The darksome wood, each glade and dell</l>

<l>But Raghu's son, whose watchful eye</l>
<l>Beheld the demon rushing nigh,</l>
<l>From the great bow he raised and bent</l>
<l>A shower of shafts to meet him sent.</l>
<l>Wild grew the fight and wilder yet</l>

<l>As when in some dark wood's retreat</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The giant bent his bow, and true</l>
<l>To Ráma's brow three arrows flew.</l>
<l>Then, raging as he felt the stroke,</l>

<l>Of fiends who rove at midnight hour?</l>

<l>Thus as he spoke his wrath grew hot,</l>
<l>And twice seven deadly shafts he shot,</l>
<l>Which, dire as serpent's deadly fang,</l>
<l>Straight to the giant's bosom sprang.</l>
<l>Four arrows more,—each shaped to deal</l>
<l>A mortal wound with barbèd steel,—</l>
<l>The glorious hero shot, and slew</l>
<l>The four good steeds the car that drew.</l>
<l>Eight other shafts flew straight and fleet,</l>
<l>And hurled the driver from his seat,</l>
<l>And in the dust the banner laid</l>
<l>That proudly o'er the chariot played.</l>
<l>Then as the fiend prepared to bound</l>
<l>Forth from his useless car to ground,</l>
<l>The hero smote him to the heart,</l>
<l>And numbed his arm with deadly smart.</l>
<l>Again the chieftain, peerless-souled,</l>
<l>Sent forth three rapid darts, and rolled</l>
<l>With each keen arrow, deftly sped,</l>
<l>Low in the dust a monstrous head.</l>
<l>Then yielding to each deadly stroke,</l>
<l>Forth spouting streams of blood and smoke,</l>
<l>The headless trunk bedrenched with gore</l>
<l>Fell to the ground and moved no more.</l>
<l>The fiends who yet were left with life,</l>
<l>Routed and crushed in battle strife,</l>
<l>To Khara's side, like trembling deer</l>
<l>Scared by the hunter, fled in fear.</l>

which he smote off the head of Namuchi.</q>

<l>His mighty bow the monster strained,</l>

<l>His mortal arrows in a flood,</l>
<l>Like serpent fangs athirst for blood.</l>
<l>Skilled in the bowman's warlike art,</l>
<l>He plied the string and poised the dart.</l>
<l>Here, on his car, and there, he rode,</l>
<l>And passages of battle showed,</l>
<l>While all the skyey regions grew</l>
<l>Dark with his arrows as they flew.</l>
<l>Then Ráma seized his ponderous bow,</l>

<l>With shafts whose stroke no life might bear</l>
<l>That filled with flash and flame the air,</l>
<l>Thick as the blinding torrents sent</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when beneath the driver's steel</l>

<pb n="262"/><anchor id="Pg262"/>
<l>And all the spirits saw him stand</l>
<l>Like Yáma with his noose in hand.</l>
<l>For Khara deemed in senseless pride</l>
<l>That he, beneath whose hand had died</l>
<l>The giant legions, failed at length</l>
<l>Slow sinking with exhausted strength.</l>
<l>But Ráma, like a lion, when</l>
<l>A trembling deer comes nigh his den,</l>
<l>Feared not the demon mad with hate,—</l>
<l>Of lion might and lion gait.</l>
<l>Then in his lofty car that glowed</l>
<l>With sunlike brilliance Khara rode</l>
<l>At Ráma: madly on he came</l>
<l>Like a poor moth that seeks the flame.</l>
<l>His archer skill the fiend displayed,</l>
<l>And at the place where Ráma laid</l>
<l>His hand, an arrow cleft in two</l>
<l>The mighty bow the hero drew.</l>
<l>Seven arrows by the giant sent,</l>
<l>Bright as the bolts of Indra, rent</l>
<l>Their way through mail and harness joints,</l>
<l>And pierced him with their iron points.</l>
<l>On Ráma, hero unsurpassed,</l>
<l>A thousand shafts smote thick and fast,</l>
<l>While as each missile struck, rang out</l>
<l>The giant's awful battle-shout.</l>
<l>His knotted arrows pierced and tore</l>
<l>The sunbright mail the hero wore,</l>
<l>Till, band and buckle rent away,</l>
<l>Glittering on the ground it lay.</l>
<l>Then pierced in shoulder, breast, and side,</l>
<l>Till every limb with blood was dyed,</l>
<l>The chieftain in majestic ire</l>
<l>Shone glorious as the smokeless fire.</l>
<l>Then loud and long the war-cry rose</l>
<l>Of Ráma, terror of his foes,</l>
<l>As, on the giant's death intent,</l>
<l>A ponderous bow he strung and bent,—</l>
<l>Lord Vishṇu's own, of wondrous size,—</l>
<l>Agastya gave the heavenly prize.</l>
<l>Then rushing on the demon foe,</l>
<l>He raised on high that mighty bow,</l>
<l>And with his well-wrought shafts, whereon</l>
<l>Bright gold between the feathers shone,</l>
<l>He struck the pennon fluttering o'er</l>
<l>The chariot, and it waved no more.</l>
<l>That glorious flag whose every fold</l>
<l>Was rich with blazonry and gold,</l>
<l>Fell as the sun himself by all</l>
<l>The Gods' decree might earthward fall.</l>
<l>From wrathful Khara's hand, whose art</l>
<l>Well knew each vulnerable part,</l>
<l>Four keenly-piercing arrows flew,</l>
<l>And blood in Ráma's bosom drew,</l>
<l>With every limb distained with gore</l>
<l>From deadly shafts which rent and tore,</l>
<l>From Khara's clanging bowstring shots,</l>
<l>The prince's wrath waxed wondrous hot.</l>
<l>His hand upon his bow that best</l>
<l>Of mighty archers firmly pressed,</l>
<l>And from the well-drawn bowstring, true</l>
<l>Each to its mark, six arrows flew.</l>
<l>One quivered in the giant's head,</l>
<l>With two his brawny shoulders bled;</l>
<l>Three, with the crescent heads they bore,</l>
<l>Deep in his breast a passage tore.</l>
<l>Thirteen, to which the stone had lent</l>
<l>The keenest point, were swiftly sent</l>
<l>On the fierce giant, every one</l>
<l>Destructive, gleaming like the sun.</l>
<l>With four the dappled steeds he slew;</l>
<l>One cleft the chariot yoke in two,</l>
<l>One, in the heat of battle sped,</l>
<l>Smote from the neck the driver's head.</l>
<l>The poles were rent apart by three;</l>
<l>Two broke the splintered axle-tree.</l>
<l>Then from the hand of Ráma, while</l>
<l>Across his lips there came a smile,</l>
<l>The twelfth, like thunderbolt impelled,</l>
<l>Cut the great hand and bow it held.</l>
<l>Then, scarce by Indra's self surpassed,</l>
<l>He pierced the giant with the last.</l>
<l>The bow he trusted cleft in twain,</l>
<l>His driver and his horses slain,</l>
<l>Down sprang the giant, mace in hand,</l>

<lg>
<l>When Ráma saw the giant nigh,</l>
<l>On foot, alone, with mace reared high,</l>
<l>In mild reproof at first he spoke,</l>
<l>Then forth his threatening anger broke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thou with the host 'twas thine to lead,</q></l>

<l>Bent his fierce brows on Raghu's son.</l>
<l>With eager eyes he looked around</l>
<l>If lethal arms might yet be found.</l>
<l>Not far away and full in view</l>
<l>A Sál-tree towering upward grew.</l>
<l>His lips in mighty strain compressed,</l>
<l>He tore it up with root and crest,</l>
<l>With huge arms waved it o'er his head</l>
<l>And hurled it shouting, Thou art dead.</l>
<l>But Ráma, unsurpassed in might,</l>
<l>Stayed with his shafts its onward flight,</l>
<l>And furious longing seized his soul</l>
<l>The giant in the dust to roll.</l>
<l>Great drops of sweat each limb bedewed,</l>
<l>His red eyes showed his wrathful mood.</l>
<l>A thousand arrows, swiftly sent,</l>
<l>The giant's bosom tore and rent.</l>
<l>From every gash his body showed</l>
<l>The blood in foamy torrents flowed,</l>
<l>As springing from their caverns leap</l>
<l>Swift rivers down the mountain steep.</l>
<l>When Khara felt each deadened power</l>
<l>Yielding beneath that murderous shower,</l>
<l>He charged, infuriate with the scent</l>
<l>Of blood, in dire bewilderment.</l>
<l>But Ráma watched, with ready bow,</l>
<l>The onset of his bleeding foe,</l>
<l>And ere the monster reached him, drew</l>
<l>Backward in haste a yard or two.</l>
<l>Then from his side a shaft he took</l>
<l>Whose mortal stroke no life might brook:</l>
<l>Of peerless might, it bore the name</l>
<l>Of Brahmá's staff, and glowed with flame:</l>
<l>Lord Indra, ruler of the skies,</l>
<l>Himself had given the glorious prize.</l>
<l>His bow the virtuous hero drew,</l>
<l>And at the fiend the arrow flew.</l>
<l>Hissing and roaring like the blast</l>
<l>Of tempest through the air it passed,</l>
<l>And fixed, by Ráma's vigour sped,</l>
<l>In the foe's breast its pointed head.</l>
<l>Then fell the fiend: the quenchless flame</l>
<l>Burnt furious in his wounded frame.</l>
<l>So burnt by Rudra Andhak<note place="foot">A demon, son of Kaśyap and Diti, slain

<l>Rain of sweet flowers upon his head.</l>
<l>For three short hours had scarcely flown,</l>
<l>And by his pointed shafts o'erthrown</l>
<l>The twice seven thousand fiends, whose will</l>

<l>But of the host of giants one,</l>
<l>Akampan, from the field had run</l>
<l>And sped to Lanká<note place="foot">The capital of the giant king Rávaṇ.</note>
to relate</l>
<l>In Rávaṇ's ear the demons' fate:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">King, many a giant from the shade</q></l>
<l>Of Janasthán in death is laid:</l>
<l>Khara the chief is slain, and I</l>
<l><q rend="post">Could scarcely from the battle fly.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce anger, as the monarch heard,</l>
<l>Inflamed his look, his bosom stirred,</l>
<l>And while with scorching glance he eyed</l>
<l>The messenger, he thus replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">What fool has dared, already dead,</q></l>
<l>Strike Janasthán, the general dread?</l>
<l>Who is the wretch shall vainly try</l>

<l>Vaiśravaṇ,<note place="foot">Kuvera, the God of gold.</note> Indra, Vishṇu, He</l>
<l>Who rules the dead, must reverence me;</l>
<l>For not the mightiest lord of these</l>
<l>Can brave my will and live at ease.</l>
<l>Fate finds in me a mightier fate</l>
<l>To burn the fires that devastate.</l>
<l>With unresisted influence I</l>
<l>Can force e'en Death himself to die,</l>
<l>With all-surpassing might restrain</l>
<l>The fury of the hurricane,</l>
<l>And burn in my tremendous ire</l>
<l><q rend="post">The glory of the sun and fire.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus the fiend's hot fury blazed,</l>
<l>His trembling hands Akampan raised,</l>
<l>And with a voice which fear made weak,</l>
<l>Permission craved his tale to speak.</l>
<l>King Rávaṇ gave the leave he sought,</l>
<l>And bade him tell the news he brought.</l>
<l>His courage rose, his voice grew bold,</l>
<l>And thus his mournful tale he told:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">A prince with mighty shoulders, sprung</q></l>
<l>From Daśaratha, brave and young,</l>
<l>With arms well moulded, bears the name</l>

<l>Renowned, successful, dark of limb,</l>
<l>Earth has no warrior equals him.</l>
<l>He fought in Janasthán and slew</l>
<l><q rend="post">Dúshaṇ the fierce and Khara too.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rávaṇ the giants' royal chief.</l>
<l>Received Akampan's tale of grief.</l>
<l>Then, panting like an angry snake,</l>
<l>These words in turn the monarch spake:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Say quick, did Ráma seek the shade</q></l>
<l>Of Janasthán with Indra's aid,</l>
<l>And all the dwellers in the skies</l>
<l><q rend="post">To back his hardy enterprise?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Akampan heard, and straight obeyed</l>
<l>His master, and his answer made.</l>
<l>Then thus the power and might he told</l>
<l>Of Raghu's son the lofty-souled:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Best is that chief of all who know</q></l>
<l>With deftest art to draw the bow.</l>
<l>His are strange arms of heavenly might,</l>
<l>And none can match him in the fight.</l>
<l>His brother Lakshmaṇ brave as he,</l>
<l>Fair as the rounded moon to see,</l>
<l>With eyes like night and voice that comes</l>
<l>Deep as the roll of beaten drums,</l>
<l>By Ráma's side stands ever near,</l>
<l>Like wind that aids the flame's career.</l>
<l>That glorious chief, that prince of kings,</l>
<l>On Janasthán this ruin brings.</l>
<l>No Gods were there,—dismiss the thought</l>
<l>No heavenly legions came and fought.</l>
<l>His swift-winged arrows Ráma sent,</l>
<l>Each bright with gold and ornament.</l>
<l>To serpents many-faced they turned:</l>
<pb n="266"/><anchor id="Pg266"/>
<l>The giant hosts they ate and burned.</l>

<l><q rend="post">Is Janasthán left desolate.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Akampan ceased: in angry pride</l>
<l>The giant monarch thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">To Janasthán myself will go</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">And lay these daring brothers low.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the king in furious mood:</l>
<l>Akampan then his speech renewed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O listen while I tell at length</q></l>
<l>The terror of the hero's strength.</l>
<l>No power can check, no might can tame</l>
<l>Ráma, a chief of noblest fame.</l>
<l>He with resistless shafts can stay</l>
<l>The torrent foaming on its way.</l>
<l>Sky, stars, and constellations, all</l>
<l>To his fierce might would yield and fall.</l>
<l>His power could earth itself uphold</l>

<l>Or all its plains and cities drown,</l>

<l>He glorious in his high estate</l>
<l>The triple world could devastate,</l>
<l>And there, supreme of men, could place</l>
<l>His creatures of a new-born race.</l>
<l>Never can mighty Ráma be</l>
<l>O'ercome in fight, my King, by thee.</l>
<l>Thy giant host the day might win</l>
<l>From him, if heaven were gained by sin.</l>
<l>If Gods were joined with demons, they</l>
<l>Could ne'er, I ween, that hero slay,</l>

<l>His wife, above all women graced,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With flattering hope of triumph moved</l>

<lg>
<l>Burning with anger, in the ring</l>
<l>Of counsellors who girt their king,</l>
<l>To Rávaṇ, ravener of man,</l>
<l>With bitter words she thus began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Wilt thou absorbed in pleasure, still</q></l>
<l>Pursue unchecked thy selfish will:</l>
<l>Nor turn thy heedless eyes to see</l>
<l>The coming fate which threatens thee?</l>
<l>The king who days and hours employs</l>
<l>In base pursuit of vulgar joys</l>
<l>Must in his people's sight be vile</l>
<l>As fire that smokes on funeral pile.</l>
<l>He who when duty calls him spares</l>
<l>No time for thought of royal cares,</l>
<l>Must with his realm and people all</l>
<l>Involved in fatal ruin fall.</l>
<l>As elephants in terror shrink</l>
<l>From the false river's miry brink,</l>
<l>Thus subjects from a monarch flee</l>
<l>Whose face their eyes may seldom see,</l>
<l>Who spends the hours for toil ordained</l>
<l>In evil courses unrestrained.</l>
<l>He who neglects to guard and hold</l>
<l>His kingdom by himself controlled,</l>
<l>Sinks nameless like a hill whose head</l>
<l>Is buried in the ocean's bed.</l>
<l>Thy foes are calm and strong and wise,</l>
<l>Fiends, Gods, and warriors of the skies,—</l>
<l>How, heedless, wicked, weak, and vain,</l>
<l>Wilt thou thy kingly state maintain?</l>
<l>Thou, lord of giants, void of sense,</l>
<l>Slave of each changing influence,</l>
<l>Heedless of all that makes a king,</l>
<l>Destruction on thy head wilt bring.</l>
<l>O conquering chief, the prince, who boasts,</l>
<l>Of treasury and rule and hosts,</l>
<l>By others led, though lord of all,</l>
<l>Is meaner than the lowest thrall.</l>
<l>For this are monarchs said to be</l>
<l>Long-sighted, having power to see</l>
<l>Things far away by faithful eyes</l>
<l>Of messengers and loyal spies.</l>
<l>But aid from such thou wilt not seek:</l>
<l>Thy counsellors are blind and weak,</l>
<l>Or thou from these hadst surely known</l>
<l>Thy legions and thy realm o'erthrown.</l>
<l>Know, twice seven thousand, fierce in might,</l>
<l>Are slain by Ráma in the fight,</l>
<l>And they, the giant host who led,</l>
<l>Khara and Dúshaṇ, both are dead.</l>
<l>Know, Ráma with his conquering arm</l>
<l>Has freed the saints from dread of harm,</l>
<l>Has smitten Janasthán and made</l>
<l>Asylum safe in Daṇḍak's shade.</l>
<l>Enslaved and dull, of blinded sight,</l>
<l>Intoxicate with vain delight,</l>
<l>Thou closest still thy heedless eyes</l>
<l>To dangers in thy realm that rise.</l>
<l>A king besotted, mean, unkind,</l>
<l>Of niggard hand and slavish mind.</l>
<l>Will find no faithful followers heed</l>
<l>Their master in his hour of need.</l>
<l>The friend on whom he most relies,</l>
<l>In danger, from a monarch flies,</l>
<l>Imperious in his high estate,</l>
<l>Conceited, proud, and passionate;</l>
<l>Who ne'er to state affairs attends</l>
<l>With wholesome fear when woe impends</l>
<l>Most weak and worthless as the grass,</l>
<l>Soon from his sway the realm will pass.</l>
<l>For rotting wood a use is found,</l>
<l>For clods and dust that strew the ground,</l>
<l>But when a king has lost his sway,</l>
<l>Useless he falls, and sinks for aye.</l>
<l>As raiment by another worn,</l>
<l>As faded garland crushed and torn,</l>
<l>So is, unthroned, the proudest king,</l>
<l>Though mighty once, a useless thing.</l>
<l>But he who every sense subdues</l>
<l>And each event observant views,</l>
<l>Rewards the good and keeps from wrong,</l>
<l>Shall reign secure and flourish long.</l>
<l>Though lulled in sleep his senses lie</l>
<l>He watches with a ruler's eye,</l>
<l>Untouched by favour, ire, and hate,</l>
<l>And him the people celebrate.</l>
<l>O weak of mind, without a trace</l>
<pb n="269"/><anchor id="Pg269"/>

<lg>
<l>Then forth the giant's fury broke</l>
<l>As Śúrpaṇakhá harshly spoke.</l>
<l>Girt by his lords the demon king</l>
<l>Looked on her, fiercely questioning:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Who is this Ráma, whence, and where?</q></l>
<l>His form, his might, his deeds declare.</l>
<l>His wandering steps what purpose led</l>

<l>What arms are his that he could smite</l>
<l>In fray the rovers of the night,</l>
<l>And Triśirás and Dúshaṇ lay</l>
<l>Low on the earth, and Khara slay?</l>
<l>Tell all, my sister, and declare</l>
<l><q rend="post">Who maimed thee thus, of form most fair.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by the giant king addressed,</l>
<l>While burnt her fury unrepressed,</l>
<l>The giantess declared at length</l>
<l>The hero's form and deeds and strength:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Long are his arms and large his eyes:</q></l>
<l>A black deer's skin his dress supplies.</l>
<l>King Daśaratha's son is he,</l>
<l>Fair as Kandarpa's self to see.</l>
<l>Adorned with many a golden band,</l>
<l>A bow, like Indra's, arms his hand,</l>
<l>And shoots a flood of arrows fierce</l>
<l>As venomed snakes to burn and pierce.</l>
<l>I looked, I looked, but never saw</l>
<l>His mighty hand the bowstring draw</l>
<l>That sent the deadly arrows out,</l>
<l>While rang through air his battle-shout.</l>
<l>I looked, I looked, and saw too well</l>
<l>How with that hail the giants fell,</l>
<l>As falls to earth the golden grain,</l>
<l>Struck by the blows of Indra's rain.</l>
<l>He fought, and twice seven thousand, all</l>
<l>Terrific giants, strong and tall,</l>
<l>Fell by the pointed shafts o'erthrown</l>
<l>Which Ráma shot on foot, alone.</l>
<l>Three little hours had scarcely fled,—</l>
<l>Khara and Dúshaṇ both were dead,</l>
<l>And he had freed the saints and made</l>
<l>Asylum sure in Daṇḍak's shade.</l>
<l>Me of his grace the victor spared,</l>
<l>Or I the giants' fate had shared.</l>
<l>The high-souled Ráma would not deign</l>
<l>His hand with woman's blood to stain.</l>
<l>The glorious Lakshmaṇ, justly dear,</l>
<l>In gifts and warrior might his peer,</l>
<l>Serves his great brother with the whole</l>
<l>Devotion of his faithful soul:</l>
<l>Impetuous victor, bold and wise,</l>
<l>First in each hardy enterprise,</l>
<l>Still ready by his side to stand,</l>
<l>A second self or better hand.</l>
<l>And Ráma has a large-eyed spouse,</l>
<l>Pure as the moon her cheek and brows,</l>
<l>Dearer than life in Ráma's sight,</l>
<l>Whose happiness is her delight.</l>
<l>With beauteous hair and nose the dame</l>
<l>From head to foot has naught to blame.</l>
<l>She shines the wood's bright Goddess, Queen</l>
<l>Of beauty with her noble mien.</l>
<l>First in the ranks of women placed</l>
<l>Is Sítá of the dainty waist.</l>
<l>In all the earth mine eyes have ne'er</l>
<l>Seen female form so sweetly fair.</l>
<l>Goddess nor nymph can vie with her,</l>
<l>Nor bride of heavenly chorister.</l>
<l>He who might call this dame his own,</l>
<l>Her eager arms about him thrown,</l>
<l>Would live more blest in Sítá's love</l>
<l>Than Indra in the world above.</l>
<l>She, peerless in her form and face</l>
<l>And rich in every gentle grace,</l>
<l>Is worthy bride, O King, for thee,</l>
<l>As thou art meet her lord to be.</l>
<l>I even I, will bring the bride</l>
<l>In triumph to her lover's side—</l>
<l>This beauty fairer than the rest,</l>
<l>With rounded limb and heaving breast.</l>
<l>Each wound upon my face I owe</l>
<l>To cruel Lakshmaṇ's savage blow.</l>
<l>But thou, O brother, shalt survey</l>
<l>Her moonlike loveliness to-day,</l>
<l>And Káma's piercing shafts shall smite</l>
<l>Thine amorous bosom at the sight.</l>
<l>If in thy breast the longing rise</l>
<l>To make thine own the beauteous prize,</l>
<l>Up, let thy better foot begin</l>
<l>The journey and the treasure win.</l>
<l>If, giant Lord, thy favouring eyes</l>
<l>Regard the plan which I advise,</l>

<l>Come, giant King, this treasure seek,</l>

<lg>
<l>When Rávaṇ, by her fury spurred,</l>
<l>That terrible advice had heard,</l>
<l>He bade his nobles quit his side,</l>
<l>And to the work his thought applied.</l>
<l>He turned his anxious mind to scan</l>
<l>On every side the hardy plan:</l>
<l>The gain against the risk he laid,</l>
<l>Each hope and fear with care surveyed,</l>
<l>And in his heart at length decreed</l>
<l>To try performance of the deed.</l>
<l>Then steady in his dire intent</l>
<l>The giant to the courtyard went.</l>
<l>There to his charioteer he cried,</l>
<l><q>Bring forth the car whereon I ride.</q></l>
<l>Aye ready at his master's word</l>
<l>The charioteer the order heard,</l>
<l>And yoked with active zeal the best</l>
<l>Of chariots at his lord's behest.</l>
<l>Asses with heads of goblins drew</l>
<l>That wondrous car where'er it flew.</l>
<l>Obedient to the will it rolled</l>
<l>Adorned with gems and glistering gold.</l>
<l>Then mounting, with a roar as loud</l>
<l>As thunder from a labouring cloud,</l>
<l>The mighty monarch to the tide</l>
<l>Of Ocean, lord of rivers, hied.</l>
<l>White was the shade above him spread,</l>
<l>White chouris waved around his head,</l>
<l>And he with gold and jewels bright</l>
<l>Shone like the glossy lazulite.</l>
<l>Ten necks and twenty arms had he:</l>
<l>His royal gear was good to see.</l>
<l>The heavenly Gods' insatiate foe,</l>
<l>Who made the blood of hermits flow,</l>
<l>He like the Lord of Hills appeared</l>
<l>With ten huge heads to heaven upreared.</l>
<l>In the great car whereon he rode,</l>
<l>Like some dark cloud the giant showed,</l>
<l>When round it in their close array</l>
<l>The cranes 'mid wreaths of lightning play.</l>
<l>He looked, and saw, from realms of air,</l>
<l>The rocky shore of ocean, where</l>
<l>Unnumbered trees delightful grew</l>
<l>With flower and fruit of every hue.</l>
<l>He looked on many a lilied pool</l>
<l>With silvery waters fresh and cool,</l>
<l>And shores like spacious altars meet</l>
<l>For holy hermits' lone retreat.</l>
<l>The graceful palm adorned the scene,</l>
<l>The plantain waved her glossy green.</l>
<l>There grew the sál and betel, there</l>
<l>On bending boughs the flowers were fair.</l>
<l>There hermits dwelt who tamed each sense</l>
<l>By strictest rule of abstinence:</l>
<l>Gandharvas, Kinnars,<note place="foot">Beings with the body of a man and the
head of a horse.</note> thronged the place,</l>
<l>Nágas and birds of heavenly race.</l>
<l>Bright minstrels of the ethereal quire,</l>
<l>And saints exempt from low desire,</l>
<l>With Ájas, sons of Brahmá's line,</l>
<l>Maríchipas of seed divine,</l>
<l>Vaikhánasas and Máshas strayed,</l>
<l>And Bálakhilyas<note place="foot">Ájas, Maríchipas, Vaikhánasas, Máshas,
and Bálakhilyas are classes of supernatural
beings who lead the lives of hermits.</note> in the shade.</l>
<l>The lovely nymphs of heaven were there,</l>
<l>Celestial wreaths confined their hair,</l>
<l>And to each form new grace was lent</l>
<l>By wealth of heavenly ornament.</l>
<l>Well skilled was each in play and dance</l>
<l>And gentle arts of dalliance.</l>
<l>The glorious wife of many a God</l>
<l>Those beautiful recesses trod,</l>
<l>There Gods and Dánavs, all who eat</l>
<l>The food of heaven, rejoiced to meet.</l>
<l>The swan and Sáras thronged each bay</l>
<l>With curlews, ducks, and divers gay,</l>
<l>Where the sea spray rose soft and white</l>
<l>O'er rocks of glossy lazulite.</l>
<l>As his swift way the fiend pursued</l>
<l>Pale chariots of the Gods he viewed,</l>
<l>Bearing each lord whose rites austere</l>
<l>Had raised him to the heavenly sphere.</l>
<l>Thereon celestial garlands hung,</l>
<l>There music played and songs were sung.</l>
<l>Then bright Gandharvas met his view,</l>
<l>And heavenly nymphs, as on he flew.</l>
<l>He saw the sandal woods below,</l>
<l>And precious trees of odorous flow,</l>
<l>That to the air around them lent</l>
<l>Their riches of delightful scent;</l>
<l>Nor failed his roving eye to mark</l>
<l>Tall aloe trees in grove and park.</l>
<l>He looked on wood with cassias filled,</l>
<l>And plants which balmy sweets distilled,</l>
<l>Where her fair flowers the betel showed</l>
<l>And the bright pods of pepper glowed.</l>
<l>The pearls in many a silvery heap</l>
<l>Lay on the margin of the deep.</l>
<l>And grey rocks rose amid the red</l>
<l>Of coral washed from ocean's bed.</l>
<pb n="271"/><anchor id="Pg271"/>
<l>High soared the mountain peaks that bore</l>
<l>Treasures of gold and silver ore,</l>
<l>And leaping down the rocky walls</l>
<l>Came wild and glorious waterfalls.</l>
<l>Fair towns which grain and treasure held,</l>
<l>And dames who every gem excelled,</l>
<l>He saw outspread beneath him far,</l>
<l>With steed, and elephant, and car.</l>
<l>That ocean shore he viewed that showed</l>
<l>Fair as the blessed Gods' abode</l>
<l>Where cool delightful breezes played</l>
<l>O'er levels in the freshest shade.</l>
<l>He saw a fig-tree like a cloud</l>
<l>With mighty branches earthward bowed.</l>
<l>It stretched a hundred leagues and made</l>
<l>For hermit bands a welcome shade.</l>
<l>Thither the feathered king of yore</l>
<l>An elephant and tortoise bore,</l>
<l>And lighted on a bough to eat</l>
<l>The captives of his taloned feet.</l>
<l>The bough unable to sustain</l>
<l>The crushing weight and sudden strain,</l>
<l>Loaded with sprays and leaves of spring</l>
<l>Gave way beneath the feathered king.</l>
<l>Under the shadow of the tree</l>
<l>Dwelt many a saint and devotee,</l>
<l>Ájas, the sons of Brahmá's line,</l>
<l>Máshas, Maríchipas divine.</l>
<l>Vaikhánasas, and all the race</l>
<l>Of Bálakhilyas, loved the place.</l>
<l>But pitying their sad estate</l>
<l>The feathered monarch raised the weight</l>
<l>Of the huge bough, and bore away</l>
<l>The loosened load and captured prey.</l>
<l>A hundred leagues away he sped,</l>
<l>Then on his monstrous booty fed,</l>
<l>And with the bough he smote the lands</l>
<l>Where dwell the wild Nisháda bands.</l>
<l>High joy was his because his deed</l>
<l>From jeopardy the hermits freed.</l>
<l>That pride for great deliverance wrought</l>
<l>A double share of valour brought.</l>
<l>His soul conceived the high emprise</l>
<l>To snatch the Amrit from the skies.</l>
<l>He rent the nets of iron first,</l>
<l>Then through the jewel chamber burst,</l>
<l>And bore the drink of heaven away</l>
<l>That watched in Indra's palace lay.</l>
</lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such was the hermit-sheltering tree</l>

<l>As guest and host are wont to meet,</l>

<l>Before the king Márícha placed</l>

<lg>
<l>Márícha gave attentive ear</l>
<l>The ruler of the fiends to hear:</l>
<l>Then, trained in all the rules that teach</l>
<l>The eloquent, began his speech:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">'Tis easy task, O King, to find</q></l>
<l>Smooth speakers who delight the mind.</l>
<l>But they who urge and they who do</l>
<l>Distasteful things and wise, are few.</l>
<l>Thou hast not learnt, by proof untaught,</l>
<l>And borne away by eager thought,</l>
<l>That Ráma, formed for high emprise,</l>
<l>With Varuṇ or with Indra vies.</l>
<l>Still let thy people live in peace,</l>
<l>Nor let their name and lineage cease,</l>
<l>For Ráma with his vengeful hand</l>
<l>Can sweep the giants from the land.</l>
<l>O, let not Janak's daughter bring</l>
<l>Destruction on the giant king.</l>
<l>Let not the lady Sítá wake</l>
<l>A tempest, on thy head to break.</l>
<l>Still let the dame, by care untried,</l>
<l>Be happy by her husband's side,</l>
<l>Lest swift avenging ruin fall</l>
<l>On glorious Lanká, thee, and all.</l>
<l>Men such as thou with wills unchained,</l>
<l>Advised by sin and unrestrained,</l>
<l>Destroy themselves, the king, the state,</l>
<l>And leave the people desolate.</l>
<l>Ráma, in bonds of duty held,</l>
<l>Was never by his sire expelled.</l>
<l>He is no wretch of greedy mind,</l>
<l>Dishonour of his Warrior kind.</l>
<l>Free from all touch of rancorous spite,</l>
<l>All creatures' good is his delight.</l>
<l>He saw his sire of truthful heart</l>
<l>Deceived by Queen Kaikeyí's art,</l>
<l>And said, a true and duteous son,</l>
<l><q>What thou hast promised shall be done.</q></l>
<l>To gratify the lady's will,</l>
<l>His father's promise to fulfil,</l>
<l>He left his realm and all delight</l>
<l>For Daṇḍak wood, an anchorite.</l>
<l>No cruel wretch, no senseless fool</l>
<l>Is Ráma, unrestrained by rule.</l>
<l>This groundless charge has ne'er been heard,</l>
<l>Nor shouldst thou speak the slanderous word.</l>
<l>Ráma in truth and goodness bold</l>
<l>Is Virtue's self in human mould,</l>
<l>The sovereign of the world confessed</l>
<l>As Indra rules among the Blest.</l>
<l>And dost thou plot from him to rend</l>
<l>The darling whom his arms defend?</l>
<l>Less vain the hope to steal away</l>
<l>The glory of the Lord of Day.</l>

<l>O Rávaṇ, guard thee from the fire</l>

<l>Each spark a shaft with deadly aim,</l>
<l>While bow and falchion feed the flame.</l>
<l>Cast not away in hopeless strife</l>
<l>Thy realm, thy bliss, thine own dear life.</l>
<l>O Rávaṇ of his might beware,</l>
<l>A God of Death who will not spare.</l>
<l>That bow he knows so well to draw</l>
<l>Is the destroyer's flaming jaw,</l>
<l>And with his shafts which flash and glow</l>
<l>He slays the armies of the foe.</l>
<l>Thou ne'er canst win—the thought forego—</l>
<l>From the safe guard of shaft and bow</l>
<l>King Janak's child, the dear delight</l>
<l>Of Ráma unapproached in might.</l>
<l>The spouse of Raghu's son, confessed</l>
<l>Lion of men with lion chest,—</l>
<l>Dearer than life, through good and ill</l>

<l>Like some vast sable cloud I showed:</l>

<l>I roved where Daṇḍak wood is spread;</l>
<l>On flesh of slaughtered saints I fed.</l>
<l>Then Viśvámitra, sage revered,</l>
<l>Holy of heart, my fury feared.</l>
<l>To Daśaratha's court he sped</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch heard the saint's request</l>

<l>The age of twelve has scarce attained.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">By Ráma's might, and his alone,</q></l>
<l>Can this great fiend be overthrown.</l>
<l>I know in days of yore the Blest</l>
<l>Thy saving help in fight confessed.</l>
<l>Still of thy famous deeds they tell</l>
<l>In heaven above, in earth, and hell,</l>
<l>A mighty host obeys thy hest:</l>
<l>Here let it still, I pray thee, rest.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: the monarch gave assent,</l>
<l>And Ráma to the hermit lent.</l>
<l>So to his woodland home in joy</l>
<l>Went Viśvámitra with the boy.</l>
<l>With ready bow the champion stood</l>
<l>To guard the rites in Daṇḍak wood.</l>
<l>With glorious eyes, most bright to view,</l>
<l>Beardless as yet and dark of hue;</l>
<l>A single robe his only wear,</l>
<l>His temples veiled with waving hair,</l>
<pb n="274"/><anchor id="Pg274"/>
<l>Around his neck a chain of gold,</l>
<l>He grasped the bow he loved to hold;</l>
<l>And the young hero's presence made</l>
<l>A glory in the forest shade.</l>
<l>Thus Ráma with his beauteous mien,</l>
<l>Like the young rising moon was seen,</l>
<l>I, like a cloud which tempest brings,</l>
<l>My arms adorned with golden rings,</l>
<l>Proud of the boon which lent me might,</l>
<l>Approached where dwelt the anchorite.</l>
<l>But Ráma saw me venturing nigh,</l>
<l>Raising my murderous axe on high;</l>
<l>He saw, and fearless of the foe,</l>
<l>Strung with calm hand his trusty bow.</l>
<l>By pride of conscious strength beguiled,</l>
<l>I scorned him as a feeble child,</l>
<l>And rushed with an impetuous bound</l>
<l>On Viśvámitra's holy ground.</l>
<l>A keen swift shaft he pointed well,</l>
<l>The foeman's rage to check and quell,</l>
<l>And hurled a hundred leagues away</l>
<l>Deep in the ocean waves I lay.</l>
<l>He would not kill, but, nobly brave,</l>
<l>My forfeit life he chose to save.</l>
<l>So there I lay with wandering sense</l>
<l>Dazed by that arrow's violence.</l>
<l>Long in the sea I lay: at length</l>
<l>Slowly returned my sense and strength,</l>
<l>And rising from my watery bed</l>
<l>To Lanká's town again I sped.</l>
<l>Thus was I spared, but all my band</l>
<l>Fell slain by Ráma's conquering hand,—</l>
<l>A boy, untrained in warrior's skill,</l>
<l>Of iron arm and dauntless will.</l>
<l>If thou with Ráma still, in spite</l>
<l>Of warning and of prayer, wilt fight,</l>
<l>I see terrific woes impend,</l>
<l>And dire defeat thy days will end.</l>
<l>Thy giants all will feel the blow</l>
<l>And share the fatal overthrow,</l>
<l>Who love the taste of joy and play,</l>
<l>The banquet and the festal day.</l>
<l>Thine eyes will see destruction take</l>
<l>Thy Lanká, lost for Sítá's sake,</l>
<l>And stately pile and palace fall</l>
<l>With terrace, dome, and jewelled wall.</l>
<l>The good will die: the crime of kings</l>
<l>Destruction on the people brings:</l>
<l>The sinless die, as in the lake</l>
<l>The fish must perish with the snake.</l>
<l>The prostrate giants thou wilt see</l>

<l>And with their wives, or widowed, fly</l>
<l>To every quarter of the sky;</l>
<l>Thy mournful eyes, where'er they turn,</l>
<l>Will see thy stately city burn,</l>
<l>When royal homes with fire are red,</l>

<l>A sin that tops all sins in shame</l>
<l>Is outrage to another's dame,</l>
<l>A thousand wives thy palace fill,</l>
<l>And countless beauties wait thy will.</l>
<l>O rest contented with thine own,</l>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">I told thee of that dreadful day</q></l>
<l>When Ráma smote and spared to slay.</l>
<l>Now hear me, Rávaṇ, while I tell</l>
<l>What in the after time befell.</l>
<l>At length, restored to strength and pride,</l>
<l>I and two mighty fiends beside</l>
<l>Assumed the forms of deer and strayed</l>
<l>Through Daṇḍak wood in lawn and glade,</l>
<l>I reared terrific horns: beneath</l>
<l>Were flaming tongue and pointed teeth.</l>
<l>I roamed where'er my fancy led,</l>
<l>And on the flesh of hermits fed,</l>
<l>In sacred haunt, by hallowed tree,</l>
<l>Where'er the ritual fires might be.</l>
<l>A fearful shape, I wandered through</l>
<l>The wood, and many a hermit slew.</l>
<l>With ruthless rage the saints I killed</l>
<l>Who in the grove their tasks fulfilled.</l>
<l>When smitten to the earth they sank,</l>
<l>Their flesh I ate, their blood I drank,</l>
<l>And with my cruel deeds dismayed</l>
<l>All dwellers in the forest shade,</l>
<l>Spoiling their rites in bitter hate,</l>
<l>With human blood inebriate.</l>
<l>Once in the wood I chanced to see</l>
<l>Ráma again, a devotee,</l>
<l>A hermit, fed on scanty fare,</l>
<l>Who made the good of all his care.</l>
<l>His noble wife was by his side,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ in the battle tried.</l>
<l>In senseless pride I scorned the might</l>
<l>Of that illustrious anchorite,</l>
<l>And heedless of a hermit foe,</l>
<l>Recalled my earlier overthrow.</l>
<pb n="275"/><anchor id="Pg275"/>
<l>I charged him in my rage and scorn</l>
<l>To slay him with my pointed horn,</l>
<l>In heedless haste, to fury wrought</l>
<l>As on my former wounds I thought.</l>
<l>Then from the mighty bow he drew</l>
<l>Three foe-destroying arrows flew,</l>
<l>Keen-pointed, leaping from the string,</l>
<l>Swift as the wind or feathered king.</l>
<l>Dire shafts, on flesh of foemen fed,</l>
<l>Like rushing thunderbolts they sped,</l>
<l>With knots well smoothed and barbs well bent,</l>
<l>Shot e'en as one, the arrows went.</l>
<l>But I who Ráma's might had felt,</l>
<l>And knew the blows the hero dealt,</l>
<l>Escaped by rapid flight. The two</l>
<l>Who lingered on the spot, he slew.</l>
<l>I fled from mortal danger, freed</l>
<l>From the dire shaft by timely speed.</l>
<l>Now to deep thought my days I give,</l>
<l>And as a humble hermit live.</l>
<l>In every shrub, in every tree</l>
<l>I view that noblest devotee.</l>
<l>In every knotted trunk I mark</l>
<l>His deerskin and his coat of bark,</l>
<l>And see the bow-armed Ráma stand</l>
<l>Like Yáma with his noose in hand.</l>
<l>I tell thee Rávaṇ, in my fright</l>
<l>A thousand Rámas mock my sight,</l>
<l>This wood with every bush and bough</l>
<l>Seems all one fearful Ráma now.</l>
<l>Throughout the grove there is no spot</l>
<l>So lonely where I see him not.</l>
<l>He haunts me in my dreams by night,</l>
<l>And wakes me with the wild affright.</l>
<l>The letter that begins his name</l>
<l>Sends terror through my startled frame.</l>
<l>The rapid cars whereon we ride,</l>
<l>The rich rare jewels, once my pride,</l>
<l>Have names<note place="foot">The Sanskrit words for car and jewels

<l>The good whose holy lives were spent</l>

<l>The grove of Janasthán and fought</l>
<l>For Śúrpaṇakhá's sake, he died</l>
<l>By Ráma's hand in battle tried.</l>

<l>But Rávaṇ scorned the rede he gave</l>
<l>In timely words to warn and save,</l>
<l>E'en as the wretch who hates to live</l>
<l>Rejects the herb the leeches give.</l>
<l>By fate to sin and ruin spurred,</l>
<l>That sage advice the giant heard,</l>
<l>Then in reproaches hard and stern</l>
<l>Thus to Márícha spoke in turn:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Is this thy counsel, weak and base,</q></l>
<l>Unworthy of thy giant race?</l>
<l>Thy speech is fruitless, vain, thy toil</l>
<l>Like casting seed on barren soil.</l>
<l>No words of thine shall drive me back</l>
<l>From Ráma and the swift attack.</l>
<l>A fool is he, inured to sin,</l>
<l>And more, of human origin.</l>
<l>The craven, at a woman's call</l>
<l>To leave his sire, his mother, all</l>
<l>The friends he loved, the power and sway,</l>
<l>And hasten to the woods away!</l>
<l>But now his anger will I rouse,</l>
<l>Stealing away his darling spouse.</l>
<l>I in thy sight will ravish her</l>
<l>From Khara's cruel murderer.</l>
<l>Upon this plan my soul is bent,</l>
<l>And naught shall move my firm intent,</l>
<l>Not if the way through demons led</l>
<l>And Gods with Indra at their head.</l>
<l>'Tis thine, when questioned, to explain</l>
<l>The hope and fear, the loss and gain,</l>
<l>And, when thy king thy thoughts would know,</l>
<l>The triumph or the danger show.</l>
<l>A prudent counsellor should wait,</l>
<l>And speak when ordered in debate,</l>
<l>With hands uplifted, calm and meek,</l>
<l>If honour and reward he seek.</l>
<l>Or, when some prudent course he sees</l>
<l>Which, spoken, may his king displease</l>
<pb n="276"/><anchor id="Pg276"/>
<l>He should by hints of dexterous art</l>
<l>His counsel to his lord impart.</l>
<l>But prudent words are said in vain</l>
<l>When the blunt speech brings grief and pain.</l>
<l>A high-souled king will scarcely thank</l>
<l>The man who shames his royal rank.</l>
<l>Five are the shapes that kings assume,</l>
<l>Of majesty, of grace, and gloom:</l>
<l>Like Indra now, or Agni, now</l>
<l>Like the dear Moon, with placid brow:</l>
<l>Like mighty Varuṇ now they show,</l>
<l>Now fierce as He who rules below.</l>
<l>O giant, monarchs lofty-souled</l>
<l>Are kind and gentle, stern and bold,</l>
<l>With gracious love their gifts dispense</l>
<l>And swiftly punish each offence.</l>
<l>Thus subjects should their rulers view</l>
<l>With all respect and honour due.</l>
<l>But folly leads thy heart to slight</l>
<l>Thy monarch and neglect his right.</l>
<l>Thou hast in lawless pride addressed</l>
<l>With bitter words thy royal guest.</l>
<l>I asked thee not my strength to scan,</l>
<l>Or loss and profit in the plan.</l>
<l>I only spoke to tell the deed</l>
<l>O mighty one, by me decreed,</l>
<l>And bid thee in the peril lend</l>
<l>Thy succour to support thy friend.</l>
<l>Hear me again, and I will tell</l>
<l>How thou canst aid my venture well.</l>
<l>In semblance of a golden deer</l>
<l>Adorned with silver drops, appear:</l>
<l>And near the cottage in the way</l>
<l>Of Ráma and his consort stray.</l>
<l>Draw nigh, and wandering through the brake</l>
<l>With thy strange form her fancy take.</l>
<l>The Maithil dame with wondering eyes</l>
<l>Will took upon thy fair disguise,</l>
<l>And quickly bid her husband go</l>
<l>And bring the deer that charms her so,</l>
<l>When Raghu's son has left the place,</l>
<l>Still pressing onward in the chase,</l>
<l>Cry out, <q>O Lakshmaṇ! Ah, mine own!</q></l>
<l>With voice resembling Ráma's tone.</l>
<l>When Lakshmaṇ hears his brother's cry,</l>
<l>Impelled by Sítá he will fly,</l>
<l>Restless with eager love, to aid</l>
<l>The hunter in the distant shade.</l>
<l>When both her guards have left her side,</l>
<l>Even as Indra, thousand-eyed,</l>
<l>Clasps Śachí, will I bear away</l>
<l>The Maithil dame an easy prey.</l>
<l>When thou, my friend, this aid hast lent,</l>
<l>Go where thou wilt and live content.</l>
<l>True servant, faithful to thy vow,</l>
<l>With half my realm I thee endow.</l>
<l>Go forth, may luck thy way attend</l>
<l>That leads thee to the happy end.</l>
<l>I in my car will quickly be</l>
<l>In Daṇḍak wood, and follow thee.</l>
<l>So will I cheat this Ráma's eyes</l>

<head>Canto XLI. Márícha's Reply.</head>

<lg>
<l>Against his judgment sorely pressed</l>
<l>By his imperious lord's behest,</l>
<l>Márícha threats of death defied</l>
<l>And thus with bitter words replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah, who, my King, with sinful thought</q></l>
<l>This wild and wicked counsel taught,</l>
<l>By which destruction soon will fall</l>
<l>On thee, thy sons, thy realm and all?</l>
<l>Who is the guilty wretch who sees</l>
<l>With envious eye thy blissful ease,</l>
<l>And by this plan, so falsely shown,</l>
<l>Death's gate for thee has open thrown?</l>
<l>With souls impelled by mean desire</l>
<l>Thy foes against thy life conspire.</l>
<l>They urge thee to destruction's brink,</l>
<l>And gladly would they see thee sink.</l>
<l>Who with base thought to work thee woe</l>
<l>This fatal road has dared to show,</l>
<l>And, triumph in his wicked eye,</l>
<l>Would see thee enter in and die?</l>
<l>To all thy counsellors, untrue,</l>
<l>The punishment of death is due,</l>
<l>Who see thee tempt the dangerous way,</l>
<l>Nor strain each nerve thy foot to stay.</l>
<l>Wise lords, whose king, by passion led,</l>
<l>The path of sin begins to tread,</l>
<l>Restrain him while there yet is time:</l>
<l>But thine,—they see nor heed the crime.</l>
<l>These by their master's will obtain</l>
<l>Merit and fame and joy and gain.</l>
<l>'Tis only by their master's grace</l>
<l>That servants hold their lofty place.</l>
<l>But when the monarch stoops to sin</l>
<l>They lose each joy they strive to win,</l>
<l>And all the people people high and low</l>
<l>Fall in the common overthrow.</l>
<pb n="277"/><anchor id="Pg277"/>
<l>Merit and fame and honour spring,</l>
<l>Best of the mighty, from the king.</l>
<l>So all should strive with heart and will</l>
<l>To keep the king from every ill.</l>
<l>Pride, violence, and sullen hate</l>
<l>Will ne'er maintain a monarch's state,</l>
<l>And those who cruel deeds advise</l>
<l>Must perish when their master dies,</l>
<l>Like drivers with their cars o'erthrown</l>
<l>In places rough with root and stone.</l>
<l>The good whose holy lives were spent</l>
<l>On duty's highest laws intent,</l>
<l>With wives and children many a time</l>
<l>Have perished for another's crime.</l>
<l>Hapless are they whose sovereign lord,</l>
<l>Opposed to all, by all abhorred,</l>
<l>Is cruel-hearted, harsh, severe:</l>
<l>Thus might a jackal tend the deer.</l>
<l>Now all the giant race await,</l>
<l>Destroyed by thee, a speedy fate,</l>
<l>Ruled by a king so cruel-souled,</l>
<l>Foolish in heart and uncontrolled.</l>
<l>Think not I fear the sudden blow</l>
<l>That threatens now to lay me low:</l>
<l>I mourn the ruin that I see</l>
<l>Impending o'er thy host and thee.</l>
<l>Me first perchance will Ráma kill,</l>
<l>But soon his hand thy blood will spill.</l>
<l>I die, and if by Ráma slain</l>
<l>And not by thee, I count it gain.</l>
<l>Soon as the hero's face I see</l>
<l>His angry eyes will murder me,</l>
<l>And if on her thy hands thou lay</l>
<l>Thy friends and thou are dead this day.</l>
<l>If with my help thou still must dare</l>
<l>The lady from her lord to tear,</l>
<l>Farewell to all our days are o'er,</l>
<l>Lanká and giants are no more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain, in vain, an earnest friend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">I warn thee, King, and pray.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou wilt not to my prayers attend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Or heed the words I say</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So men, when life is fleeting fast</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">And death's sad hour is nigh,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heedless and blinded to the last</l>

<head>Canto XLII. Márícha Transformed.</head>

<lg>
<l>Márícha thus in wild unrest</l>
<l>With bitter words the king addressed.</l>
<l>Then to his giant lord in dread,</l>
<l><q>Arise, and let us go,</q> he said.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah, I have met that mighty lord</q></l>
<l>Armed with his shafts and bow and sword,</l>
<l>And if again that bow he bend</l>
<l>Our lives that very hour will end.</l>
<l>For none that warrior can provoke</l>
<l>And think to fly his deadly stroke.</l>
<l>Like Yáma with his staff is he,</l>
<l>And his dread hand will slaughter thee.</l>
<l>What can I more? My words can find</l>
<l>No passage to thy stubborn mind.</l>
<l>I go, great King, thy task to share,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And may success attend thee there.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With that reply and bold consent</l>
<l>The giant king was well content.</l>
<l>He strained Márícha to his breast</l>
<l>And thus with joyful words addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">There spoke a hero dauntless still,</q></l>
<l>Obedient to his master's will,</l>
<l>Márícha's proper self once more:</l>
<l>Some other took thy shape before.</l>
<l>Come, mount my jewelled car that flies.</l>
<l>Will-governed, through the yielding skies.</l>
<l>These asses, goblin-faced, shall bear</l>
<l>Us quickly through the fields of air.</l>
<l>Attract the lady with thy shape,</l>
<l>Then through the wood, at will, escape.</l>
<l>And I, when she has no defence,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Will seize the dame and bear her thence.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again Márícha made reply,</l>
<l>Consent and will to signify.</l>
<l>With rapid speed the giants two</l>
<l>From the calm hermit dwelling flew,</l>
<l>Borne in that wondrous chariot, meet</l>
<l>For some great God's celestial seat.</l>
<l>They from their airy path looked down</l>
<l>On many a wood and many a town,</l>
<l>On lake and river, brook and rill,</l>
<l>City and realm and towering hill.</l>
<l>Soon he whom giant hosts obeyed,</l>
<l>Márícha by his side, surveyed</l>
<l>The dark expanse of Daṇḍak wood</l>
<l>Where Ráma's hermit cottage stood.</l>
<l>They left the flying car, whereon</l>
<l>The wealth of gold and jewels shone,</l>
<l>And thus the giant king addressed</l>
<l>Márícha as his hand he pressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Márícha, look! before our eyes</q></l>
<l>Round Ráma's home the plantains rise.</l>
<l>His hermitage is now in view:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Quick to the work we came to do!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Rávaṇ spoke, Márícha heard</l>
<l>Obedient to his master's word,</l>
<l>Threw off his giant shape and near</l>
<l>The cottage strayed a beauteous deer.</l>
<l>With magic power, by rapid change,</l>
<l>His borrowed form was fair and strange.</l>
<l>A sapphire tipped each horn with light;</l>
<l>His face was black relieved with white.</l>
<l>The turkis and the ruby shed</l>
<l>A glory from his ears and head.</l>
<l>His arching neck was proudly raised,</l>
<l>And lazulites beneath it blazed.</l>
<l>With roseate bloom his flanks were dyed,</l>
<l>And lotus tints adorned his hide.</l>
<l>His shape was fair, compact, and slight;</l>
<pb n="278"/><anchor id="Pg278"/>
<l>His hoofs were carven lazulite.</l>
<l>His tail with every changing glow</l>
<l>Displayed the hues of Indra's bow.</l>
<l>With glossy skin so strangely flecked,</l>
<l>With tints of every gem bedecked.</l>
<l>A light o'er Ráma's home he sent,</l>
<l>And through the wood, where'er he went.</l>
<l>The giant clad in that strange dress</l>
<l>That took the soul with loveliness,</l>
<l>To charm the fair Videhan's eyes</l>
<l>With mingled wealth of mineral dyes,</l>
<l>Moved onward, cropping in his way,</l>
<l>The grass and grain and tender spray.</l>
<l>His coat with drops of silver bright,</l>
<l>A form to gaze on with delight,</l>
<l>He raised his fair neck as he went</l>
<l>To browse on bud and filament.</l>
<l>Now in the Cassia grove he strayed,</l>
<l>Now by the cot in plantains' shade.</l>
<l>Slowly and slowly on he came</l>
<l>To catch the glances of the dame,</l>
<l>And the tall deer of splendid hue</l>
<l>Shone full at length in Sítá's view.</l>
<l>He roamed where'er his fancy chose</l>
<l>Where Ráma's leafy cottage rose.</l>
<l>Now near, now far, in careless ease,</l>
<l>He came and went among the trees.</l>
<l>Now with light feet he turned to fly,</l>
<l>Now, reassured, again drew nigh:</l>
<l>Now gambolled close with leap and bound,</l>
<l>Now lay upon the grassy ground:</l>
<l>Now sought the door, devoid of fear,</l>
<l>And mingled with the troop of deer;</l>
<l>Led them a little way, and thence</l>
<l>Again returned with confidence.</l>
<l>Now flying far, now turning back</l>
<l>Emboldened on his former track,</l>
<l>Seeking to win the lady's glance</l>
<l>He wandered through the green expanse.</l>
<l>Then thronging round, the woodland deer</l>
<l>Gazed on his form with wondering fear;</l>
<l>A while they followed where he led,</l>
<l>Then snuffed the tainted gale and fled.</l>
<l>The giant, though he longed to slay</l>
<l>The startled quarry, spared the prey,</l>
<l>And mindful of the shape he wore</l>
<l>To veil his nature, still forbore.</l>
<l>Then Sítá of the glorious eye,</l>
<l>Returning from her task drew nigh;</l>
<l>For she had sought the wood to bring</l>
<l>Each loveliest flower of early spring.</l>
<l>Now would the bright-eyed lady choose</l>
<l>Some gorgeous bud with blending hues,</l>
<l>Now plucked the mango's spray, and now</l>
<l>The bloom from an Aśoka bough.</l>
<l>She with her beauteous form, unmeet</l>
<l>For woodland life and lone retreat,</l>
<l>That wondrous dappled deer beheld</l>
<l>Gemmed with rich pearls, unparalleled,</l>
<l>His silver hair the lady saw,</l>
<l>His radiant teeth and lips and jaw,</l>
<l>And gazed with rapture as her eyes</l>
<l>Expanded in their glad surprise.</l>
<l>And when the false deer's glances fell</l>
<l>On her whom Ráma loved so well,</l>
<l>He wandered here and there, and cast</l>
<l>A luminous beauty as he passed;</l>
<l>And Janak's child with strange delight</l>
<l>Kept gazing on the unwonted sight.</l>

<lg>
<l>She stooped, her hands with flowers to fill,</l>
<l>But gazed upon the marvel still:</l>
<l>Gazed on its back and sparkling side</l>
<l>Where silver hues with golden vied.</l>
<l>Joyous was she of faultless mould,</l>
<l>With glossy skin like polished gold.</l>
<l>And loudly to her husband cried</l>
<l>And bow-armed Lakshmaṇ by his side:</l>
<l>Again, again she called in glee:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O come this glorious creature see;</q></l>
<l>Quick, quick, my lord, this deer to view.</l>
<l><q rend="post">And bring thy brother Lakshmaṇ too.</q></l>
<l>As through the wood her clear tones rang,</l>
<l>Swift to her side the brothers sprang.</l>
<l>With eager eyes the grove they scanned,</l>
<l>And saw the deer before them stand.</l>
<l>But doubt was strong in Lakshmaṇ's breast,</l>
<l>Who thus his thought and fear expressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Stay, for the wondrous deer we see</q></l>
<l>The fiend Márícha's self may be.</l>
<l>Ere now have kings who sought this place</l>
<l>To take their pastime in the chase,</l>
<l>Met from his wicked art defeat,</l>
<l>And fallen slain by like deceit.</l>
<l>He wears, well trained in magic guile,</l>
<l>The figure of a deer a while,</l>
<l>Bright as the very sun, or place</l>
<l>Where dwell the gay Gandharva race.</l>
<l>No deer, O Ráma, e'er was seen</l>
<l>Thus decked with gold and jewels' sheen.</l>
<l>'Tis magic, for the world has ne'er,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Lord of the world, shown aught so fair.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Sítá of the lovely smile,</l>
<l>A captive to the giant's wile,</l>
<l>Turned Lakshmaṇ's prudent speech aside</l>
<l>And thus with eager words replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My honoured lord, this deer I see</q></l>
<l>With beauty rare enraptures me.</l>
<l>Go, chief of mighty arm, and bring</l>
<l>For my delight this precious thing.</l>
<l>Fair creatures of the woodland roam</l>
<l>Untroubled near our hermit home.</l>
<l>The forest cow and stag are there,</l>
<l>The fawn, the monkey, and the bear,</l>
<l>Where spotted deer delight to play,</l>

<l>And strong and beauteous Kinnars<note place="foot">A race of beings of human shape but
with the heads of horses, like centaurs reversed.</note> stray.</l>
<l>But never, as they wandered by,</l>
<l>Has such a beauty charmed mine eye</l>
<l>As this with limbs so fair and slight,</l>
<l>So gentle, beautiful and bright.</l>
<l>O see, how fair it is to view</l>
<l>With jewels of each varied hue:</l>
<l>Bright as the rising moon it glows,</l>
<l>Lighting the wood where'er it goes.</l>
<l>Ah me, what form and grace are there!</l>
<l>Its limbs how fine, its hues how fair!</l>
<l>Transcending all that words express,</l>
<l>It takes my soul with loveliness.</l>
<l>O, if thou would, to please me, strive</l>
<l>To take the beauteous thing alive,</l>
<l>How thou wouldst gaze with wondering eyes</l>
<l>Delighted on the lovely prize!</l>
<l>And when our woodland life is o'er,</l>
<l>And we enjoy our realm once more,</l>
<l>The wondrous animal will grace</l>
<l>The chambers of my dwelling-place,</l>
<l>And a dear treasure will it be</l>
<l>To Bharat and the queens and me,</l>
<l>And all with rapture and amaze</l>
<l>Upon its heavenly form will gaze.</l>
<l>But if the beauteous deer, pursued,</l>
<l>Thine arts to take it still elude,</l>
<l>Strike it, O chieftain, and the skin</l>
<l>Will be a treasure, laid within.</l>
<l>O, how I long my time to pass</l>
<l>Sitting upon the tender grass,</l>
<l>With that soft fell beneath me spread</l>
<l>Bright with its hair of golden thread!</l>
<l>This strong desire, this eager will,</l>
<l>Befits a gentle lady ill:</l>
<l>But when I first beheld, its look</l>
<l>My breast with fascination took.</l>
<l>See, golden hair its flank adorns,</l>
<l>And sapphires tip its branching horns.</l>
<l>Resplendent as the lunar way,</l>
<l>Or the first blush of opening day,</l>
<l>With graceful form and radiant hue</l>
<l><q rend="post">It charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He heard her speech with willing ear,</l>
<l>He looked again upon the deer.</l>
<l>Its lovely shape his breast beguiled</l>
<l>Moved by the prayer of Janak's child,</l>
<l>And yielding for her pleasure's sake,</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ Ráma turned and spake:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Mark, Lakshmaṇ, mark how Sítá's breast</q></l>
<l>With eager longing is possessed.</l>
<l>To-day this deer of wondrous breed</l>
<l>Must for his passing beauty bleed,</l>
<l>Brighter than e'er in Nandan strayed,</l>
<l>Or Chaitraratha's heavenly shade.</l>
<l>How should the groves of earth possess</l>
<l>Such all-surpassing loveliness!</l>
<l>The hair lies smooth and bright and fine,</l>
<l>Or waves upon each curving line,</l>
<l>And drops of living gold bedeck</l>
<l>The beauty of his side and neck.</l>
<l>O look, his crimson tongue between</l>
<l>His teeth like flaming fire is seen,</l>
<l>Flashing, whene'er his lips he parts,</l>
<l>As from a cloud the lightning darts.</l>
<l>O see his sunlike forehead shine</l>
<l>With emerald tints and almandine,</l>
<l>While pearly light and roseate glow</l>
<l>Of shells adorn his neck below.</l>
<l>No eye on such a deer can rest</l>
<l>But soft enchantment takes the breast:</l>
<l>No man so fair a thing behold</l>
<l>Ablaze with light of radiant gold,</l>
<l>Celestial, bright with jewels' sheen,</l>
<l>Nor marvel when his eyes have seen.</l>
<l>A king equipped with bow and shaft</l>
<l>Delights in gentle forest craft,</l>
<l>And as in boundless woods he strays</l>
<l>The quarry for the venison slays.</l>
<l>There as he wanders with his train</l>
<l>A store of wealth he oft may gain.</l>
<l>He claims by right the precious ore,</l>
<l>He claims the jewels' sparkling store.</l>
<l>Such gains are dearer in his eyes</l>
<l>Than wealth that in his chamber lies,</l>
<l>The dearest things his spirit knows,</l>
<l>Dear as the bliss which Śukra chose.</l>
<l>But oft the rich expected gain</l>
<l>Which heedless men pursue in vain,</l>
<l>The sage, who prudent counsels know,</l>
<l>Explain and in a moment show.</l>
<l>This best of deer, this gem of all,</l>
<l>To yield his precious spoils must fall,</l>
<l>And tender Sítá by my side</l>
<l>Shall sit upon the golden hide.</l>
<l>Ne'er could I find so rich a coat</l>
<l>On spotted deer or sheep or goat.</l>
<l>No buck or antelope has such,</l>
<l>So bright to view, so soft to touch.</l>
<l>This radiant deer and one on high</l>
<l>That moves in glory through the sky,</l>
<l>Alike in heavenly beauty are,</l>
<l>One on the earth and one a star.</l>
<l>But, brother, if thy fears be true,</l>

<l>The holiest saints who haunt the shade.</l>
<l>Great archers, sprung of royal race,</l>
<l>Pursuing in the wood the chase,</l>

<l>Vátápi, when the rite was o'er,</l>

<l>Thus having warned his brother bold</l>
<l>He grasped his sword with haft of gold,</l>
<l>And bow with triple flexure bent,</l>
<l>His own delight and ornament;</l>
<l>Then bound two quivers to his side,</l>
<l>And hurried forth with eager stride.</l>

<l>The hunter's heart was wroth and grieved,</l>
<l>And wearied with the fruitless chase</l>
<l>He stayed him in a shady place.</l>
<l>Again the rover of the night</l>
<l>Enraged the chieftain, full in sight,</l>
<l>Slow moving in the coppice near,</l>
<l>Surrounded by the woodland deer.</l>
<l>Again the hunter sought the game</l>
<l>That seemed a while to court his aim:</l>
<l>But seized again with sudden dread,</l>
<l>Beyond his sight the creature fled.</l>
<l>Again the hero left the shade,</l>
<l>Again the deer before him strayed.</l>
<l>With surer hope and stronger will</l>
<l>The hunter longed his prey to kill.</l>
<l>Then as his soul impatient grew,</l>
<l>An arrow from his side he drew,</l>
<l>Resplendent at the sunbeam's glow,</l>
<l>The crusher of the smitten foe.</l>
<l>With skillful heed the mighty lord</l>
<l>Fixed well shaft and strained the cord.</l>
<l>Upon the deer his eyes he bent,</l>
<l>And like a fiery serpent went</l>
<l>The arrow Brahma's self had framed,</l>
<l>Alive with sparks that hissed and flamed,</l>
<l>Like Indra's flashing levin, true</l>
<l>To the false deer the missile flew</l>
<l>Cleaving his flesh that wonderous dart</l>
<l>Stood quivering in Márícha's heart.</l>
<l>Scarce from the ground one foot he sprang,</l>
<l>Then stricken fell with deadly pang.</l>
<l>Half lifeless, as he pressed the ground,</l>
<l>He gave a roar of awful sound</l>
<l>And ere the wounded giant died</l>
<l>He threw his borrowed form aside</l>
<l>Remembering still his lord's behest</l>
<l>He pondered in his heart how best</l>
<l>Sítá might send her guard away,</l>
<l>And Rávaṇ seize the helpless prey.</l>
<l>The monster knew the time was nigh,</l>
<l>And called aloud with eager cry,</l>
<l><q>Ho, Sítá, Lakshmaṇ</q> and the tone</l>
<pb n="281"/><anchor id="Pg281"/>
<l>He borrowed was like Ráma's own.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So by that matchless arrow cleft,</l>
<l>The deer's bright form Márícha left,</l>
<l>Resumed his giant shape and size</l>
<l>And closed in death his languid eyes.</l>
<l>When Ráma saw his awful foe</l>
<l>Gasp, smeared with blood, in deadly throe,</l>
<l>His anxious thoughts to Sítá sped,</l>
<l>And the wise words that Lakshmaṇ said,</l>
<l>That this was false Márícha's art,</l>
<l>Returned again upon his heart.</l>
<l>He knew the foe he triumphed o'er</l>
<l>The name of great Márícha bore.</l>
<l><q>The fiend,</q> he pondered, 'ere he died,</l>
<l><q>Ho, Lakshmaṇ! ho, my Sítá!</q> cried</l>
<l>Ah, if that cry has reached her ear,</l>
<l>How dire must be my darling's fear!</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ of the mighty arm,</l>
<l>What thinks he in his wild alarm?</l>
<l>As thus he thought in sad surmise,</l>
<l>Each startled hair began to rise,</l>
<l>And when he saw the giant slain</l>
<l>And thought upon that cry again,</l>
<l>His spirit sank and terror pressed</l>
<l>Full sorely on the hero's breast.</l>
<l>Another deer he chased and struck,</l>
<l>He bore away the the fallen buck,</l>
<l>To Janasthán then turned his face</l>
<l>And hastened to his dwelling place.</l>

<l>Called to her guardian, <q rend="pre">Lakshmaṇ, run</q></l>

<l>Scarce can my heart retain its throne,</l>
<l>Scarce can my life be called mine own,</l>
<l>As all my powers and senses fail</l>
<l>At that long, loud and bitter wail.</l>
<l>Haste to the wood with all thy speed</l>
<l>And save thy brother in his need.</l>
<l>Go, save him in the distant glade</l>
<l>Where loud he calls, for timely aid.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deaf to her prayer, no step he stirred</l>
<l>Obedient to his mother's word,</l>
<l>Then Janak's child, with ire inflamed,</l>
<l>In words of bitter scorn exclaimed exclaimed</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Sumitrá's son, a friend in show,</q></l>
<l>Thou art in truth thy brother's foe,</l>
<l>Who canst at such any hour deny</l>
<l>Thy succour and neglect his cry.</l>
<l>Yes, Lakshmaṇ, smit with love of me</l>
<l>Thy brother's death thou fain wouldst see.</l>
<l>This guilty love thy heart has swayed</l>
<l>And makes thy feet so loth to aid.</l>
<l>Thou hast no love for Ráma, no:</l>

<l>Hence thus unmoved thou yet canst stay</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the lady sad with fear,</l>
<l>With many a sigh and many a tear,</l>

<l>I tell thee, of the sons of earth,</l>

<l>Of beasts and birds and giant hosts,</l>
<l>Of demigods, Gandharvas, ghosts,</l>
<l>Of awful fiends, O thou most fair,</l>
<l>There lives not one whose heart would dare</l>
<l>To meet thy Ráma in the fight,</l>
<l>Like Indra's self unmatched in might.</l>
<l>Such idle words thou must not say</l>

<l>I will not, cannot leave thee here</l>
<l>In the wild wood till he be near.</l>
<l>The mightiest strength can ne'er withstand</l>
<l>His eager force, his vigorous hand.</l>
<l>No, not the triple world allied</l>
<l>With all the immortal Gods beside.</l>
<l>Dismiss thy fear, again take heart,</l>
<l>Let all thy doubt and woe depart.</l>
<l>Thy lord, be sure, will soon be here</l>
<l>And bring thee back that best of deer.</l>
<l>Not his, not his that mournful cry,</l>
<l>Nor haply came it from the sky.</l>
<l>Some giant's art was busy there</l>

<l>A precious pledge art thou, consigned</l>
<l>To me by him of noblest mind,</l>
<l>Nor can I fairest dame, forsake</l>
<l>The pledge which Ráma bade me take.</l>
<l>Upon our heads, O Queen, we drew</l>
<l>The giants' hate when Ráma slew</l>

<l>The angry Lakshmaṇ scarce could brook</l>

<l>A staff and water-vessel hung.</l>
<l>Near to the lovely dame he drew,</l>
<l>While both the chiefs were far from view,</l>
<l>As darkness takes the evening air</l>

<l>A melancholy murmur gave.</l>
<l>Then Rávaṇ, when his eager eye</l>

<l>With her bright teeth and each fair limb</l>
<l>Like the full moon she seemed to him,</l>
<l>Sitting within her leafy cot,</l>

<l>May every good be thine! my name</l>
<l>Is Sítá, Ráma's cherished dame.</l>
<l>Twelve winters with my lord I spent</l>
<l>Most happily with sweet content</l>
<l>In the rich home of Raghu's line,</l>
<l>And every earthly joy was mine.</l>
<l>Twelve pleasant years flew by, and then</l>
<l>His peers advised the king of men,</l>
<l>Ráma, my lord, to consecrate</l>
<l>Joint ruler of his ancient state.</l>
<l>But when the rites were scarce begun,</l>
<l>To consecrate Ikshváku's son,</l>
<l>The queen Kaikeyí, honoured dame,</l>
<l>Sought of her lord an ancient claim.</l>
<l>Her plea of former service pressed,</l>
<l>And made him grant her new request,</l>
<l>To banish Ráma to the wild</l>
<l>And consecrate instead her child.</l>
<l>This double prayer on him, the best</l>
<l>And truest king, she strongly pressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Mine eyes in sleep I will not close,</q></l>
<l>Nor eat, nor drink, nor take repose.</l>
<l>This very day my death shall bring</l>
<l><q rend="post">If Ráma be anointed king.</q></l>
<l>As thus she spake in envious ire,</l>
<l>The aged king, my husband's sire,</l>
<l>Besought with fitting words; but she</l>
<l>Was cold and deaf to every plea.</l>
<l>As yet my days are few; eighteen</l>
<l>The years of life that I have seen;</l>
<l>And Ráma, best of all alive,</l>
<l>Has passed of years a score and five—</l>
<l>Ráma the great and gentle, through</l>
<l>All region famed as pure and true,</l>
<l>Large-eyed and mighty-armed and tall,</l>
<l>With tender heart that cares for all.</l>
<l>But Daśaratha, led astray</l>
<l>By woman's wile and passion's sway,</l>
<l>By his strong love of her impelled,</l>
<l>The consecrating rites withheld.</l>
<l>When, hopeful of the promised grace,</l>
<l>My Ráma sought his father's face,</l>
<l>The queen Kaikeyí, ill at ease,</l>
<l>Spoke to my lord brief words like these:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Hear, son of Raghu, hear from me</q></l>
<l>The words thy father says to thee:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I yield this day to Bharat's hand,</q></l>
<l>Free from all foes, this ancient land.</l>

<l>And dwell in woods five years and nine.</l>
<l>Live in the forest and maintain</l>
<l><q rend="post"><q rend="post">Mine honour pure from falsehood's stain.</q></q></l>
<l>Then Ráma spoke, untouched by dread:</l>
<l><q>Yea, it shall be as thou hast said.</q></l>
<l>And answered, faithful to his vows,</l>
<l>Obeying Daśaratha's spouse:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The offered realm I would not take,</q></l>

<l>Clung to his vow with firmest will.</l>
<l>And valiant Lakshmaṇ, dear to fame,</l>
<l>His brother by a younger dame,</l>
<l>Bold victor in the deadly fray,</l>
<l>Would follow Ráma on his way.</l>
<l>On sternest vows his heart was set,</l>
<l>And he, a youthful anchoret,</l>
<l>Bound up in twisted coil his hair</l>
<l>And took the garb which hermits wear;</l>
<l>Then with his bow to guard us, he</l>
<l>Went forth with Ráma and with me.</l>
<l>By Queen Kaikeyí's art bereft</l>
<l>The kingdom and our home we left,</l>
<l>And bound by stern religious vows</l>
<l>We sought this shade of forest boughs.</l>
<l>Now, best of Bráhmans, here we tread</l>
<l>These pathless regions dark and dread.</l>
<l>But come, refresh thy soul, and rest</l>
<l>Here for a while an honoured guest,</l>
<l>For he, my lord, will soon be here</l>
<l>With fresh supply of woodland cheer,</l>
<l>Large store of venison of the buck,</l>
<l>Or some great boar his hand has struck.</l>
<l>Meanwhile, O stranger, grant my prayer:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus questioned Sítá, Ráma's dame.</l>
<l>Then fierce the stranger's answer came:</l>

<l>My love, O thou of perfect mould,</l>

<l>A thousand fairest women, torn</l>

<l>Nor shall thy happy breast retain</l>

<l>The fool who thinks with idle aim</l>
<l>To gain the love of Ráma's dame,</l>
<l>With dark and desperate footing makes</l>

<l>The stranger made his fierce reply:</l>

<l>The brother of the King of Gold.</l>
<l>The Lord of Ten Necks my title, named</l>

<l>Celestial hosts by Indra led</l>

<l>Its golden courts enchant the sight,</l>

<l>Steeds, elephants, and cars are there,</l>

<l>For love, whose words were soft and sweet.</l>
<l>Near and more near the giant pressed</l>
<l>As love's hot fire inflamed his breast.</l>
<l>The leader of the giant crew</l>
<l>His arm around the lady threw:</l>
<l>Thus Budha<note place="foot">Mercury: to be carefully distinguished

<l>One hand her glorious tresses grasped,</l>
<l>One with its ruthless pressure clasped</l>
<l>The body of his lovely prize,</l>
<l>The Maithil dame with lotus eyes.</l>
<l>The silvan Gods in wild alarm</l>
<l>Marked his huge teeth and ponderous arm,</l>
<l>And from that Death-like presence fled,</l>
<l>Of mountain size and towering head.</l>
<l>Then seen was Rávaṇ's magic car</l>
<l>Aglow with gold which blazed afar,—</l>
<l>The mighty car which asses drew</l>
<l>Thundering as it onward flew.</l>
<l>He spared not harsh rebuke to chide</l>
<l>The lady as she moaned and cried,</l>
<l>Then with his arm about her waist</l>
<l>His captive in the car he placed.</l>
<l>In vain he threatened: long and shrill</l>
<l>Rang out her lamentation still,</l>
<l>O Ráma! which no fear could stay:</l>
<l>But her dear lord was far away.</l>
<l>Then rose the fiend, and toward the skies</l>

<l>So might a soaring eagle bear</l>
<l>A serpent's consort through the air.</l>

<l>Thy captive, known by Sítá's name,</l>

<l>Lord of the world in might he vies</l>
<l>With the great Gods of seas and skies.</l>
<l>The law he boasts to keep allows</l>
<l>No king to touch another's spouse,</l>
<l>And, more than all, a prince's dame</l>
<l>High honour and respect may claim.</l>
<l>Back to the earth thy way incline,</l>

<l>Heroic souls should hold it shame</l>

<l>Long be the good man's dwelling-place.</l>
<l>Prince Ráma, chief of high renown,</l>

<l>Home to thy heart a venomed snake!</l>
<l>Ah foolish eyes, too blind to see</l>
<l>That Death's dire coils entangle thee!</l>
<l>The prudent man his strength will spare,</l>

<head>Canto LI. The Combat.</head>

<lg>
<l>Rávaṇ's red eyes in fury rolled:</l>
<l>Bright with his armlets' flashing gold,</l>
<l>In high disdain, by passion stirred</l>
<l>He rushed against the sovereign bird.</l>
<l>With clash and din and furious blows</l>
<l>Of murderous battle met the foes:</l>
<l>Thus urged by winds two clouds on high</l>
<l>Meet warring in the stormy sky.</l>
<l>Then fierce the dreadful combat raged</l>
<l>As fiend and bird in war engaged,</l>
<l>As if two winged mountains sped</l>
<l>To dire encounter overhead.</l>
<l>Keen pointed arrows thick and fast,</l>
<l>In never ceasing fury cast,</l>
<l>Rained hurtling on the vulture king</l>
<l>And smote him on the breast and wing.</l>
<l>But still that noblest bird sustained</l>
<l>The cloud of shafts which Rávaṇ rained,</l>
<l>And with strong beak and talons bent</l>
<l>The body of his foeman rent.</l>
<l>Then wild with rage the ten-necked king</l>
<l>Laid ten swift arrows on his string,—</l>
<l>Dread as the staff of Death were they,</l>
<l>So terrible and keen to slay.</l>
<l>Straight to his ear the string he drew,</l>
<l>Straight to the mark the arrows flew,</l>
<l>And pierced by every iron head</l>
<l>The vulture's mangled body bled.</l>
<l>One glance upon the car he bent</l>
<l>Where Sítá wept with shrill lament,</l>
<l>Then heedless of his wounds and pain</l>
<l>Rushed at the giant king again.</l>
<l>Then the brave vulture with the stroke</l>
<l>Of his resistless talons broke</l>
<l>The giant's shafts and bow whereon</l>
<l>The fairest pearls and jewels shone.</l>
<l>The monster paused, by rage unmanned:</l>
<l>A second bow soon armed his hand,</l>
<l>Whence pointed arrows swift and true</l>
<l>In hundreds, yea in thousands, flew.</l>
<l>The monarch of the vultures, plied</l>
<l>With ceaseless darts on every side,</l>
<l>Showed like a bird that turns to rest</l>
<l>Close covered by the branch-built nest.</l>
<l>He shook his pinions to repel</l>
<l>The storm of arrows as it fell;</l>
<l>Then with his talons snapped in two</l>
<l>The mighty bow which Rávaṇ drew.</l>
<l>Next with terrific wing he smote</l>
<l>So fiercely on the giant's coat,</l>
<l>The harness, glittering with the glow</l>
<l>Of fire, gave way beneath the blow.</l>
<l>With storm of murderous strokes he beat</l>
<l>The harnessed asses strong and fleet,—</l>
<l>Each with a goblin's monstrous face</l>
<l>And plates of gold his neck to grace.</l>
<l>Then on the car he turned his ire,—</l>
<l>The will-moved car that shone like fire,</l>
<l>And broke the glorious chariot, broke</l>
<l>The golden steps and pole and yoke.</l>
<l>The chouris and the silken shade</l>
<l>Like the full moon to view displayed,</l>
<l>Together with the guards who held</l>
<l>Those emblems, to the ground he felled.</l>
<l>The royal vulture hovered o'er</l>
<l>The driver's head, and pierced and tore</l>
<l>With his strong beak and dreaded claws</l>
<l>His mangled brow and cheek and jaws.</l>
<l>With broken car and sundered bow,</l>
<l>His charioteer and team laid low,</l>
<l>One arm about the lady wound,</l>
<l>Sprang the fierce giant to the ground.</l>
<l>Spectators of the combat, all</l>
<l>The spirits viewed the monster's fall:</l>
<l>Lauding the vulture every one</l>
<l>Cried with glad voice, Well done! well done!</l>
<l>But weak with length of days, at last</l>
<l>The vulture's strength was failing fast.</l>
<l>The fiend again assayed to bear</l>
<l>The lady through the fields of air.</l>
<l>But when the vulture saw him rise</l>
<l>Triumphant with his trembling prize,</l>
<l>Bearing the sword that still was left</l>
<l>When other arms were lost or cleft,</l>
<l>Once more, impatient of repose,</l>
<l>Swift from the earth her champion rose,</l>
<l>Hung in the way the fiend would take,</l>
<l>And thus addressing Rávaṇ spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thou, King of giants, rash and blind,</q></l>
<l>Wilt be the ruin of thy kind,</l>
<l>Stealing the wife of Ráma, him</l>
<l>With lightning scars on chest and limb.</l>
<l>A mighty host obeys his will</l>
<l>And troops of slaves his palace fill;</l>
<pb n="290"/><anchor id="Pg290"/>
<l>His lords of state are wise and true,</l>
<l>Kinsmen has he and retinue.</l>
<l>As thirsty travellers drain the cup,</l>
<l>Thou drinkest deadly poison up.</l>
<l>The rash and careless fool who heeds</l>
<l>No coming fruit of guilty deeds,</l>
<l>A few short years of life shall see,</l>
<l>And perish doomed to death like thee.</l>
<l>Say whither wilt thou fly to loose</l>
<l>Thy neck from Death's entangling noose,</l>
<l>Caught like the fish that finds too late</l>
<l>The hook beneath the treacherous bait?</l>
<l>Never, O King—of this be sure—</l>
<l>Will Raghu's fiery sons endure,</l>
<l>Terrific in their vengeful rage,</l>
<l>This insult to their hermitage.</l>
<l>Thy guilty hands this day have done</l>
<l>A deed which all reprove and shun,</l>
<l>Unworthly of a noble chief,</l>
<l>The pillage loved by coward thief.</l>
<l>Stay, if thy heart allow thee, stay</l>
<l>And meet me in the deadly fray.</l>
<l>Soon shall thou stain the earth with gore,</l>
<l>And fall as Khara fell before.</l>
<l>The fruits of former deeds o'erpower</l>
<l>The sinner in his dying hour:</l>
<l>And such a fate on thee, O King,</l>
<l>Thy tyranny and madness bring.</l>
<l>Not e'en the Self-existent Lord,</l>
<l>Who reigns by all the worlds adored,</l>
<l>Would dare attempt a guilty deed</l>
<l><q rend="post">Which the dire fruits of crime succeed.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus brave Jaṭáyus, best of birds,</l>
<l>Addressed the fiend with moving words,</l>
<l>Then ready for the swift attack</l>
<l>Swooped down upon the giant's back.</l>
<l>Down to the bone the talons went;</l>
<l>With many a wound the flesh was rent:</l>
<l>Such blows infuriate drivers deal</l>
<l>Their elephants with pointed steel.</l>
<l>Fixed in his back the strong beak lay,</l>
<l>The talons stripped the flesh away.</l>
<l>He fought with claws and beak and wing,</l>
<l>And tore the long hair of the king.</l>
<l>Still as the royal vulture beat</l>
<l>The giant with his wings and feet,</l>
<l>Swelled the fiend's lips, his body shook</l>
<l>With furious rage too great to brook.</l>
<l>About the Maithil dame he cast</l>
<l>One huge left arm and held her fast.</l>
<l>In furious rage to frenzy fanned</l>
<l>He struck the vulture with his hand.</l>
<l>Jatáyus mocked the vain assay,</l>
<l>And rent his ten left arms away.</l>
<l>Down dropped the severed limbs: anew</l>
<l>Ten others from his body grew:</l>
<l>Thus bright with pearly radiance glide</l>
<l>Dread serpents from the hillock side,</l>
<l>Again in wrath the giant pressed</l>
<l>The lady closer to his breast,</l>
<l>And foot and fist sent blow on blow</l>
<l>In ceaseless fury at the foe.</l>
<l>So fierce and dire the battle, waged</l>
<l>Between those mighty champions, raged:</l>
<l>Here was the lord of giants, there</l>
<l>The noblest of the birds of air.</l>
<l>Thus, as his love of Ráma taught,</l>
<l>The faithful vulture strove and fought.</l>
<l>But Rávaṇ seized his sword and smote</l>
<l>His wings and side and feet and throat.</l>
<l>At mangled side and wing he bled;</l>
<l>He fell, and life was almost fled.</l>
<l>The lady saw her champion lie,</l>
<l>His plumes distained with gory dye,</l>
<l>And hastened to the vulture's side</l>
<l>Grieving as though a kinsman died.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lord of Lanká's island viewed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">The vulture as he lay:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose back like some dark cloud was hued,</l>

<l>Fair as the lord of silvery rays</l>

<l>Our coming lot of weal and woe:</l>

<l>The birds and deer desert the brakes</l>
<l>And show the path my captor takes,</l>
<l>And thus e'en now this royal bird</l>
<l>Flew to mine aid by pity stirred.</l>
<l>Slain for my sake in death he lies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her flowery wreath was torn and rent,</l>
<l>Crushed was each sparkling ornament.</l>
<l>She with weak arms and trembling knees</l>
<l>Clung like a creeper to the trees,</l>
<l>And like some poor deserted thing</l>
<l>With wild shrieks made the forest ring.</l>
<l>But swift the giant reached her side,</l>

<l>The universal world in awe</l>
<l>That outrage on the lady saw,</l>
<l>All nature shook convulsed with dread,</l>
<l>And darkness o'er the land was spread.</l>
<l>The Lord of Day grew dark and chill,</l>
<l>And every breath of air was still.</l>
<l>The Eternal Father of the sky</l>
<l>Beheld the crime with heavenly eye,</l>
<l>And spake with solemn voice, <q rend="pre">The deed,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The deed is done, of old decreed.</q></l>
<l>Sad were the saints within the grove,</l>
<l>But triumph with their sorrow strove.</l>
<l>They wept to see the Maithil dame</l>
<l>Endure the outrage, scorn, and shame:</l>
<l>They joyed because his life should pay</l>
<l>The penalty incurred that day.</l>
<l>Then Rávaṇ raised her up, and bare</l>
<l>His captive through the fields of air,</l>
<l>Calling with accents loud and shrill</l>
<l>On Ráma and on Lakshmaṇ still.</l>
<l>With sparkling gems on arm and breast,</l>
<l>In silk of paly amber dressed,</l>
<l>High in the air the Maithil dame</l>
<l>Gleamed like the lightning's flashing flame.</l>
<l>The giant, as the breezes blew</l>
<l>Upon her robes of amber hue,</l>
<l>And round him twined that gay attire,</l>
<l>Showed like a mountain girt with fire.</l>
<l>The lady, fairest of the fair,</l>
<l>Had wreathed a garland round her hair;</l>
<l>Its lotus petals bright and sweet</l>
<l>Rained down about the giant's feet.</l>
<l>Her vesture, bright as burning gold,</l>
<l>Gave to the wind each glittering fold,</l>
<l>Fair as a gilded cloud that gleams</l>
<l>Touched by the Day-God's tempered beams.</l>
<l>Yet struggling in the fiend's embrace,</l>
<l>The lady with her sweet pure face,</l>
<l>Far from her lord, no longer wore</l>
<l>The light of joy that shone before.</l>
<l>Like some sad lily by the side</l>
<l>Of waters which the sun has dried;</l>
<l>Like the pale moon uprising through</l>
<l>An autumn cloud of darkest hue,</l>
<l>So was her perfect face between</l>
<l>The arms of giant Rávaṇ seen:</l>
<l>Fair with the charm of braided tress</l>
<l>And forehead's finished loveliness;</l>
<l>Fair with the ivory teeth that shed</l>
<l>White lustre through the lips' fine red,</l>
<l>Fair as the lotus when the bud</l>
<l>Is rising from the parent flood.</l>
<l>With faultless lip and nose and eye,</l>
<l>Dear as the moon that floods the sky</l>
<l>With gentle light, of perfect mould,</l>
<l>She seemed a thing of burnished gold,</l>
<l>Though on her cheek the traces lay</l>
<l>Of tears her hand had brushed away.</l>
<l>But as the moon-beams swiftly fade</l>
<l>Ere the great Day-God shines displayed,</l>
<l>So in that form of perfect grace</l>
<l>Still trembling in the fiend's embrace,</l>
<l>From her beloved Ráma reft,</l>
<l>No light of pride or joy was left.</l>
<l>The lady with her golden hue</l>
<l>O'er the swart fiend a lustre threw,</l>
<l>As when embroidered girths enfold</l>
<l>An elephant with gleams of gold.</l>
<l>Fair as the lily's bending stem,—</l>
<l>Her arms adorned with many a gem,</l>
<l>A lustre to the fiend she lent</l>
<l>Gleaming from every ornament,</l>
<l>As when the cloud-shot flashes light</l>
<l>The shadows of a mountain height.</l>
<l>Whene'er the breezes earthward bore</l>
<l>The tinkling of the zone she wore,</l>
<l>He seemed a cloud of darkness hue</l>
<l>Sending forth murmurs as it flew.</l>
<l>As on her way the dame was sped</l>
<l>From her sweet neck fair flowers were shed,</l>
<l>The swift wind caught the flowery rain</l>
<l>And poured it o'er the fiend again.</l>
<l>The wind-stirred blossoms, sweet to smell,</l>
<l>On the dark brows of Rávaṇ fell,</l>
<l>Like lunar constellations set</l>
<l>On Meru for a coronet.</l>
<l>From her small foot an anklet fair</l>
<l>With jewels slipped, and through the air,</l>
<l>Like a bright circlet of the flame</l>
<l>Of thunder, to the valley came.</l>
<l>The Maithil lady, fair to see</l>
<l>As the young leaflet of a tree</l>
<l>Clad in the tender hues of spring,</l>
<l>Flashed glory on the giant king,</l>
<l>As when a gold-embroidered zone</l>
<l>Around an elephant is thrown.</l>
<l>While, bearing far the lady, through</l>
<l>The realms of sky the giant flew,</l>
<l>She like a gleaming meteor cast</l>
<l>A glory round her as she passed.</l>
<l>Then from each limb in swift descent</l>
<l>Dropped many a sparkling ornament:</l>
<l>On earth they rested dim and pale</l>
<l>Like fallen stars when virtues fail.<note place="foot">The spirits of the good dwell

<l>From every woodland region near</l>
<l>Came lions, tigers, birds, and deer,</l>

<l>Soon as the Maithil lady knew</l>

<l>Her troubled spirit sank dismayed.</l>
<l>Then, as anew the waters welled</l>

<l>He bore her on in rapid flight,</l>
<l>And not a friend appeared in sight.</l>
<l>But on a hill that o'er the wood</l>
<l>Raised its high top five monkeys stood.</l>
<l>From her fair neck her scarf she drew,</l>
<l>And down the glittering vesture flew.</l>
<l>With earring, necklet, chain, and gem,</l>
<l>Descending in the midst of them:</l>
<l><q>For these,</q> she thought, <q rend="pre">my path may show,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">And tell my lord the way I go.</q></l>
<l>Nor did the fiend, in wild alarm,</l>
<l>Mark when she drew from neck and arm</l>
<l>And foot the gems and gold, and sent</l>
<l>To earth each gleaming ornament.</l>
<l>The monkeys raised their tawny eyes</l>
<l>That closed not in their first surprise,</l>
<l>And saw the dark-eyed lady, where</l>
<l>She shrieked above them in the air.</l>
<l>High o'er their heads the giant passed</l>
<l>Holding the weeping lady fast.</l>
<l>O'er Pampa's flashing flood he sped</l>
<l>And on to Lanká's city fled.</l>
<l>He bore away in senseless joy</l>
<l>The prize that should his life destroy,</l>
<l>Like the rash fool who hugs beneath</l>
<l>His robe a snake with venomed teeth.</l>
<l>Swift as an arrow from a bow,</l>
<l>Speeding o'er lands that lay below,</l>
<l>Sublime in air his course he took</l>
<l>O'er wood and rock and lake and brook.</l>
<l>He passed at length the sounding sea</l>
<l>Where monstrous creatures wander free,—</l>
<l>Seat of Lord Varuṇ's ancient reign,</l>
<l>Controller of the eternal main.</l>
<l>The angry waves were raised and tossed</l>
<l>As Rávaṇ with the lady crossed,</l>
<l>And fish and snake in wild unrest</l>
<l>Showed flashing fin and gleaming crest.</l>
<l>Then from the blessed troops who dwell</l>
<l>In air celestial voices fell:</l>
<l><q>O ten-necked King,</q> they cried, <q rend="pre">attend:</q></l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Rávaṇ speeding like the storm,</l>
<l>Bearing his death in human form,</l>
<l>The struggling Sítá, lighted down</l>
<l>In royal Lanká's glorious town;</l>
<l>A city bright and rich, that showed</l>
<l>Well-ordered street and noble road;</l>
<l>Arranged with just division, fair</l>
<l>With multitudes in court and square.</l>
<l>Thus, all his journey done, he passed</l>
<l>Within his royal home at last.</l>
<l>There in a queenly bower he placed</l>
<l>The black-eyed dame with dainty waist:</l>
<l>Thus in her chamber Máyá laid</l>
<l>The lovely Máyá, demon maid.</l>
<l>Then Rávaṇ gave command to all</l>
<l>The dread she-fiends who filled the hall:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This captive lady watch and guard</q></l>
<l>From sight of man and woman barred.</l>
<l>But all the fair one asks beside</l>
<l>Be with unsparing hand supplied:</l>

<l>No pearls or dress or gems or gold.</l>

<l>A glorious host that region held,</l>
<l>For power and might unparalleled,</l>
<l>By Dúshaṇ and brave Khara led,—</l>
<l>All, slain by Ráma's arrows, bled.</l>
<l>Hence boundless wrath that spurns control</l>

<l>Thus Rávaṇ his commandment gave</l>
<l>To those eight giants strong and brave,</l>
<l>So thinking in his foolish pride</l>
<l>Against all dangers to provide.</l>
<l>Then with his wounded heart aflame</l>
<l>With love he thought upon the dame,</l>
<l>And took with hasty steps the way</l>
<l>To the fair chamber where she lay.</l>
<l>He saw the gentle lady there</l>
<l>Weighed down by woe too great to bear,</l>
<l>Amid the throng of fiends who kept</l>
<l>Their watch around her as she wept:</l>
<l>A pinnace sinking neath the wave</l>
<l>When mighty winds around her rave:</l>
<l>A lonely herd-forsaken deer,</l>
<l>When hungry dogs are pressing near.</l>
<l>Within the bower the giant passed:</l>
<l>Her mournful looks were downward cast.</l>
<l>As there she lay with streaming eyes</l>
<l>The giant bade the lady rise,</l>
<l>And to the shrinking captive showed</l>
<l>The glories of his rich abode,</l>
<l>Where thousand women spent their days</l>
<l>In palaces with gold ablaze;</l>
<l>Where wandered birds of every sort,</l>
<l>And jewels flashed in hall and court.</l>
<l>Where noble pillars charmed the sight</l>
<l>With diamond and lazulite,</l>
<l>And others glorious to behold</l>
<l>With ivory, crystal, silver, gold.</l>
<l>There swelled on high the tambour's sound,</l>
<l>And burnished ore was bright around</l>
<l>He led the mournful lady where</l>
<l>Resplendent gold adorned the stair,</l>
<l>And showed each lattice fair to see</l>
<l>With silver work and ivory:</l>
<l>Showed his bright chambers, line on line,</l>
<l>Adorned with nets of golden twine.</l>
<l>Beyond he showed the Maithil dame</l>
<l>His gardens bright as lightning's flame,</l>
<l>And many a pool and lake he showed</l>
<l>Where blooms of gayest colour glowed.</l>
<l>Through all his home from view to view</l>
<l>The lady sunk in grief he drew.</l>
<l>Then trusting in her heart to wake</l>
<l>Desire of all she saw, he spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Three hundred million giants, all</q></l>
<l>Obedient to their master's call,</l>
<l>Not counting young and weak and old,</l>
<l>Serve me with spirits fierce and bold.</l>

<l>Wait on the lord they long to please.</l>

<l>In all the worlds above, below,</l>

<l>Her gentle life in jeopardy.</l>
<l>Go, Indra, swiftly seek the place,</l>
<l>And look upon her lovely face.</l>
<l>Within the city make thy way:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Let heavenly food her spirit stay.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Brahma spake: and He who slew</l>
<l>The cruel demon Páka, flew</l>
<l>Where Lanká's royal city lay,</l>
<l>And Sleep went with him on his way.</l>
<l><q>Sleep,</q> cried the heavenly Monarch, <q rend="pre">close</q></l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Indra spoke, and Sleep fulfilled</l>
<l>With joy his mandate, as he willed,</l>
<l>To aid the plan the Gods proposed,</l>
<l>The demons' eyes in sleep she closed.</l>
<l>Then Śachí's lord, the Thousand-eyed,</l>
<l>To the Aśoka garden hied.</l>
<l>He came and stood where Sítá lay,</l>
<l>And gently thus began to say:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Lord of the Gods who hold the sky,</q></l>
<l>Dame of the lovely smile, am I.</l>
<l>Weep no more, lady, weep no more;</l>
<l>Thy days of woe will soon be o'er.</l>
<l>I come, O Janak's child, to be</l>
<l>The helper of thy lord and thee.</l>
<l>He through my grace, with hosts to aid,</l>
<l>This sea-girt land will soon invade.</l>
<l>'Tis by my art that slumbers close</l>
<l>The eyelids of thy giant foes.</l>
<l>Now I, with Sleep, this place have sought,</l>
<l>Videhan lady, and have brought</l>
<l>A gift of heaven's ambrosial food</l>
<l>To stay thee in thy solitude.</l>
<l>Receive it from my hand, and taste,</l>
<l>O lady of the dainty waist:</l>
<l>For countless ages thou shall be</l>
<l><q rend="post">From pangs of thirst and hunger free.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But doubt within her bosom woke</l>
<l>As to the Lord of Gods she spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">How may I know for truth that thou</q></l>
<l>Whose form I see before me now</l>
<l>Art verily the King adored</l>
<l>By heavenly Gods, and Śachí's lord?</l>
<l>With Raghu's sons I learnt to know</l>
<l>The certain signs which Godhead show.</l>
<l>These marks before mine eyes display</l>
<l><q rend="post">If o'er the Gods thou bear the sway.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The heavenly lord of Śachí heard,</l>
<l>And did according to her word.</l>
<l>Above the ground his feet were raised;</l>
<l>With eyelids motionless he gazed.</l>
<l>No dust upon his raiment lay,</l>
<l>And his bright wreath was fresh and gay.</l>
<l>Nor was the lady's glad heart slow</l>
<l>The Monarch of the Gods to know,</l>
<l>And while the tears unceasing ran</l>
<l>From her sweet eyes she thus began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My lord has gained a friend in thee,</q></l>
<l>And I this day thy presence see</l>
<l>Shown clearly to mine eyes, as when</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ, lords of men,</l>
<l>Beheld it, and their sire the king,</l>
<l>And Janak too from whom I spring.</l>
<l>Now I, O Monarch of the Blest,</l>
<l>Will eat this food at thy behest,</l>
<l>Which thou hast brought me, of thy grace,</l>
<l><q rend="post">To aid and strengthen Raghu's race.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She spoke, and by his words relieved,</l>
<l>The food from Indra's hand received,</l>
<l>Yet ere she ate the balm he brought,</l>
<l>On Lakshmaṇ and her lord she thought.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">If my brave lord be still alive,</q></l>
<l>If valiant Lakshmaṇ yet survive,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 4">She ate, and that celestial food</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stayed hunger, thirst, and lassitude,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">And all her strength restored.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great joy her hopeful spirit stirred</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At the glad tidings newly heard</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Of Lakshmaṇ and her lord.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Indra's heart was joyful too:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He bade the Maithil dame adieu,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">His saving errand done.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Sleep beside him parting thence</l>

<lg>
<l>When Ráma's deadly shaft had struck</l>
<l>The giant in the seeming buck,</l>
<l>The chieftain turned him from the place</l>
<l>His homeward way again to trace.</l>
<l>Then as he hastened onward, fain</l>
<l>To look upon his spouse again,</l>
<l>Behind him from a thicket nigh</l>
<l>Rang out a jackal's piercing cry.</l>
<l>Alarmed he heard the startling shriek</l>
<l>That raised his hair and dimmed his cheek,</l>
<l>And all his heart was filled with doubt</l>
<l>As the shrill jackal's cry rang out:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Alas, some dire disaster seems</q></l>
<l>Portended by the jackal's screams.</l>
<l>O may the Maithil dame be screened</l>
<l>From outrage of each hungry fiend!</l>
<pb n="298"/><anchor id="Pg298"/>
<l>Alas, if Lakshmaṇ chanced to hear</l>
<l>That bitter cry of woe and fear</l>
<l>What time Márícha, as he died,</l>
<l>With voice that mocked my accents cried,</l>
<l>Swift to my side the prince would flee</l>
<l>And quit the dame to succour me.</l>
<l>Too well I see the demon band</l>
<l>The slaughter of my love have planned.</l>
<l>Me far from home and Sítá's view</l>
<l>The seeming deer Márícha drew.</l>
<l>He led me far through brake and dell</l>
<l>Till wounded by my shaft he fell,</l>
<l>And as he sank rang out his cry,</l>
<l><q>O save me, Lakshmaṇ, or I die.</q></l>
<l>May it be well with both who stayed</l>
<l>In the great wood with none to aid,</l>
<l>For every fiend is now my foe</l>
<l>For Janasthán's great overthrow,</l>
<l>And many an omen seen to-day</l>
<l><q rend="post">Has filled my heart with sore dismay.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such were the thoughts and sad surmise</l>
<l>Of Ráma at the jackal's cries,</l>
<l>And all his heart within him burned</l>
<l>As to his cot his steps he turned.</l>
<l>He pondered on the deer that led</l>
<l>His feet to follow where it fled,</l>
<l>And sad with many a bitter thought</l>
<l>His home in Janasthán he sought.</l>
<l>His soul was dark with woe and fear</l>
<l>When flocks of birds and troops of deer</l>
<l>Move round him from the left, and raised</l>
<l>Discordant voices as they gazed.</l>
<l>The omens which the chieftain viewed</l>
<l>The terror of his soul renewed,</l>
<l>When lo, to meet him Lakshmaṇ sped</l>
<l>With brows whence all the light had fled.</l>
<l>Near and more near the princes came,</l>
<l>Each brother's heart and look the same;</l>
<l>Alike on each sad visage lay</l>
<l>The signs of misery and dismay,</l>
<l>Then Ráma by his terror moved</l>
<l>His brother for his fault reproved</l>
<l>In leaving Sítá far from aid</l>
<l>In the wild wood where giants strayed.</l>
<l>Lakshmaṇ's left hand he took, and then</l>
<l>In gentle tones the prince of men,</l>
<l>Though sharp and fierce their tenour ran,</l>
<l>Thus to his brother chief began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">O Lakshmaṇ, thou art much to blame</q></l>
<l>Leaving alone the Maithil dame,</l>
<l>And flying hither to my side:</l>
<l>O, may no ill my spouse betide!</l>
<l>But ah, I know my wife is dead,</l>
<l>And giants on her limbs have fed,</l>
<l>So strange, so terrible are all</l>
<l>The omens which my heart appal.</l>
<l>O Lakshmaṇ, may we yet return</l>
<l>The safety of my love to learn.</l>
<l>To find the child of Janak still</l>
<l>Alive and free from scathe and ill!</l>
<l>Each bird with notes of warning screams,</l>
<l>Though the hot sun still darts his beams.</l>
<l>The moan of deer, the jackal's yell</l>
<l>Of some o'erwhelming misery tell.</l>
<l>O mighty brother, still may she,</l>
<l>My princess, live from danger free!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That semblance of a golden deer</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">Allured me far away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I followed nearer and more near,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">I followed where the quarry fled:</l>

<head>Canto LIX. Ráma's Return.</head>

<lg>
<l>When Ráma saw his brother stand</l>
<l>With none beside him, all unmanned,</l>
<l>Eager he questioned why he came</l>
<l>So far without the Maithil dame:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Where is my wife, my darling, she</q></l>
<l>Who to the wild wood followed me?</l>
<l>Where hast thou left my lady, where</l>
<l>The dame who chose my lot to share?</l>
<l>Where is my love who balms my woe</l>
<l>As through the forest wilds I go,</l>
<l>Unkinged and banished and disgraced,—</l>
<l>My darling of the dainty waist?</l>
<l>She nerves my spirit for the strife,</l>
<l>She, only she gives zest to life,</l>
<l>Dear as my breath is she who vies</l>
<l>In charms with daughters of the skies.</l>
<l>If Janak's child be mine no more,</l>
<l>In splendour fair as virgin ore,</l>
<l>The lordship of the skies and earth</l>
<l>To me were prize of little worth.</l>
<l>Ah, lives she yet, the Maithil dame,</l>
<l>Dear as the soul within this frame?</l>
<l>O, let not all my toil be vain,</l>
<l>The banishment, the woe and pain!</l>
<l>O, let not dark Kaikeyí win</l>
<l>The guerdon of her treacherous sin,</l>
<l>If, Sítá lost, my days I end,</l>
<l>And thou without me homeward wend!</l>
<l>O, let not good Kauśalyá shed</l>
<l>Her bitter tears to mourn me dead,</l>
<l>Nor her proud rival's hest obey,</l>
<l>Strong in her son and queenly sway!</l>
<l>Back to my cot will I repair</l>
<l>If Sítá live to greet me there,</l>
<pb n="299"/><anchor id="Pg299"/>
<l>But if my wife have perished, I</l>
<l>Reft of my love will surely die.</l>
<l>O Lakshmaṇ, if I seek my cot,</l>
<l>Look for my love and find her not</l>
<l>Sweet welcome with her smile to give,</l>
<l>I tell thee, I will cease to live.</l>
<l>O answer,—let thy words be plain,—</l>
<l>Lives Sítá yet, or is she slain?</l>
<l>Didst thou thy sacred trust betray</l>
<l>Till ravening giants seized the prey?</l>
<l>Ah me, so young, so soft and fair,</l>
<l>Lapped in all bliss, untried by care,</l>
<l>Rent from her own dear husband, how</l>
<l>Will she support her misery now?</l>
<l>That voice, O Lakshmaṇ smote thine ear,</l>
<l>And filled, I ween, thy heart with fear,</l>
<l>When on thy name for succour cried</l>
<l>The treacherous giant ere he died.</l>
<l>That voice too like mine own, I ween,</l>
<l>Was heard by the Videhan queen.</l>
<l>She bade thee seek my side to aid,</l>
<l>And quickly was the hest obeyed,</l>
<l>But ah, thy fault I needs must blame,</l>
<l>To leave alone the helpless dame,</l>
<l>And let the cruel giants sate</l>
<l>The fury of their murderous hate.</l>
<l>Those blood-devouring demons all</l>
<l>Grieve in their souls for Khara's fall,</l>
<l>And Sítá, none to guard her side,</l>
<l>Torn by their cruel hands has died.</l>
<l>I sink, O tamer of thy foes,</l>
<l>Deep in the sea of whelming woes.</l>
<l>What can I now? I must endure</l>
<l><q rend="post">The mighty grief that mocks at cure.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, all his thoughts on Sítá bent,</l>
<l>To Janasthán the chieftain went,</l>
<l>Hastening on with eager stride,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ hurried by his side.</l>
<l>With toil and thirst and hunger worn,</l>
<l>His breast with doubt and anguish torn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sought the well-known spot.</l>
<l>Again, again he turned to chide</l>
<l>With quivering lips which terror dried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He looked, and found her not.</l>
<l>Within his leafy home he sped,</l>
<l>Each pleasant spot he visited</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where oft his darling strayed.</l>
<l><q>'Tis as I feared,</q> he cried, and there,</l>
<l>Yielding to pangs too great to bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sank by grief dismayed.</l>

<lg>
<l>But Ráma ceased not to upbraid,</l>
<l>His brother for untimely aid,</l>
<l>And thus, while anguish wrung his breast,</l>
<l>The chief with eager question pressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Why, Lakshmaṇ, didst thou hurry hence</q></l>
<l>And leave my wife without defence?</l>
<l>I left her in the wood with thee,</l>
<l>And deemed her safe from jeopardy.</l>
<l>When first thy form appeared in view,</l>
<l>I marked that Sítá came not too.</l>
<l>With woe my troubled soul was rent,</l>
<l>Prophetic of the dire event.</l>
<l>Thy coming steps afar I spied,</l>
<l>I saw no Sítá by thy side,</l>
<l>And felt a sudden throbbing dart</l>
<l><q rend="post">Through my left eye, and arm, and heart.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lakshmaṇ, with Fortune's marks impressed,</l>
<l>His brother mournfully addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Not by my heart's free impulse led,</q></l>
<l>Leaving thy wife to thee I sped;</l>
<l>But by her keen reproaches sent,</l>
<l>O Ráma, to thine aid I went.</l>
<l>She heard afar a mournful cry,</l>
<l><q>O save me, Lakshmaṇ, or I die.</q></l>
<l>The voice that spoke in moving tone</l>
<l>Smote on her ear and seemed thine own.</l>
<l>Soon as those accents reached her ear</l>
<l>She yielded to her woe and fear,</l>
<l>She wept o'ercome by grief, and cried,</l>
<l><q>Fly, Lakshmaṇ, fly to Ráma's side.</q></l>
<l>Though many a time she bade me speed,</l>
<l>Her urgent prayer I would not heed.</l>
<l>I bade her in thy strength confide,</l>
<l>And thus with tender words replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">No giant roams the forest shade</q></l>
<l>From whom thy lord need shrink dismayed.</l>
<l>No human voice, believe me, spoke</l>
<l>Those words thy causeless fear that woke.</l>
<l>Can he whose might can save in woe</l>
<l>The heavenly Gods e'er stoop so low,</l>
<l>And with those piteous accents call</l>
<l>For succour like a caitiff thrall?</l>
<l>And why should wandering giants choose</l>
<l>The accents of thy lord to use,</l>
<l>In alien tones my help to crave,</l>
<l>And cry aloud, O Lakshmaṇ, save?</l>
<l>Now let my words thy spirit cheer,</l>
<l>Compose thy thoughts and banish fear.</l>
<l>In hell, in earth, or in the skies</l>
<l>There is not, and there cannot rise</l>
<l>A champion whose strong arm can slay</l>
<l>Thy Ráma in the battle fray.</l>
<l>To heavenly hosts he ne'er would yield</l>
<l><q rend="post">Though Indra led them to the field.</q></l>
<l>To soothe her thus I vainly sought:</l>
<l>Her heart with woe was still distraught.</l>
<l>While from her eyes the waters ran</l>
<l>Her bitter speech she thus began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Too well I see thy dark intent:</q></l>
<l>Thy lawless thoughts on me are bent.</l>
<l>Thou hopest, but thy hope is vain,</l>
<l>To win my love, thy brother slain.</l>
<l>Not love, but Bharat's dark decree</l>
<l>To share his exile counselled thee,</l>
<pb n="300"/><anchor id="Pg300"/>
<l>Or hearing now his bitter cry</l>
<l>Thou surely to his aid wouldst fly.</l>
<l>For love of me, a stealthy foe</l>
<l>Thou choosest by his side to go,</l>
<l>And now thou longest that my lord</l>
<l><q rend="post">Should die, and wilt no help afford.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such were the words the lady said:</l>
<l>With angry fire my eyes were red.</l>
<l>With pale lips quivering in my rage</l>
<l><q rend="post">I hastened from the hermitage.</q></l>
<l>He ceased; and frenzied by his pain</l>
<l>The son of Raghu spoke again:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O brother, for thy fault I grieve,</q></l>
<l>The Maithil dame alone to leave.</l>
<l>Thou knowest that my arm is strong</l>
<l>To save me from the giant throng,</l>
<l>And yet couldst leave the cottage, spurred</l>
<l>To folly by her angry word.</l>
<l>For this thy deed I praise thee not,—</l>
<l>To leave her helpless in the cot,</l>
<l>And thus thy sacred charge forsake</l>
<l>For the wild words a woman spake.</l>
<l>Yea thou art all to blame herein,</l>
<l>And very grievous is thy sin.</l>
<l>That anger swayed thy faithless breast</l>
<l>And made thee false to my behest.</l>
<l>An arrow speeding from my bow</l>
<l>Has laid the treacherous giant low,</l>
<l>Who lured me eager for the chase</l>
<l>Far from my hermit dwelling-place.</l>
<l>The string with easy hand I drew,</l>
<l>The arrow as in pastime flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wounded quarry bled.</l>
<l>The borrowed form was cast away,</l>
<l>Before mine eye a giant lay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With bright gold braceleted.</l>
<l>My arrow smote him in the chest:</l>

<lg>
<l>As Ráma sought his leafy cot</l>
<l>Through his left eye keen throbbings shot,</l>
<l>His wonted strength his frame forsook,</l>
<l>And all his body reeled and shook.</l>
<l>Still on those dreadful signs he thought,—</l>
<l>Sad omens with disaster fraught,</l>
<l>And from his troubled heart he cried,</l>
<l><q>O, may no ill my spouse betide!</q></l>
<l>Longing to gaze on Sítá's face</l>
<l>He hastened to his dwelling-place,</l>
<l>Then sinking neath his misery's weight,</l>
<l>He looked and found it desolate.</l>
<l>Tossing his mighty arms on high</l>
<l>He sought her with an eager cry,</l>
<l>From spot to spot he wildly ran</l>
<l>Each corner of his home to scan.</l>
<l>He looked, but Sítá was not there;</l>
<l>His cot was disolate and bare,</l>
<l>Like streamlet in the winter frost,</l>
<l>The glory of her lilies lost.</l>
<l>With leafy tears the sad trees wept</l>
<l>As a wild wind their branches swept.</l>
<l>Mourned bird and deer, and every flower</l>
<l>Drooped fainting round the lonely bower.</l>
<l>The silvan deities had fled</l>
<l>The spot where all the light was dead,</l>
<l>Where hermit coats of skin displayed,</l>
<l>And piles of sacred grass were laid.</l>
<l>He saw, and maddened by his pain</l>
<l>Cried in lament again, again:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Where is she, dead or torn away,</q></l>
<l>Lost, or some hungry giant's prey?</l>
<l>Or did my darling chance to rove</l>

<l><q rend="post">Her pitcher from the wave to fill?</q></l>
<l>His eager eyes on fire with pain</l>
<l>He roamed about with maddened brain.</l>
<l>Each grove and glade he searched with care,</l>
<l>He sought, but found no Sítá there.</l>
<l>He wildly rushed from hill to hill;</l>
<l>From tree to tree, from rill to rill,</l>
<l>As bitter woe his bosom rent</l>

<l>And marked each sign which struck his sense</l>
<l>With mute expressive influence,</l>
<l>Then as again his sorrow woke</l>
<l>Thus to his brother chief he spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Those deer thy eager question heard</q></l>
<pb n="305"/><anchor id="Pg305"/>
<l>And rose at once by pity stirred:</l>
<l>See, in thy search their aid they lend,</l>
<l>See, to the south their looks they bend.</l>
<l>Arise, dear brother, let us go</l>
<l>The way their eager glances show,</l>
<l>If haply sign or trace descried</l>
<l><q rend="post">Our footsteps in the search may guide.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Raghu gave assent,</l>
<l>And quickly to the south they went;</l>
<l>With eager eyes the earth he scanned,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ followed close at hand.</l>
<l>As each to other spake his thought,</l>
<l>And round with anxious glances sought,</l>
<l>Scattered before them in the way,</l>
<l>Blooms of a fallen garland lay.</l>
<l>When Ráma saw that flowery rain</l>
<l>He spoke once more with bitterest pain:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Lakshmaṇ every flower that lies</q></l>
<l>Here on the ground I recognize.</l>
<l>I culled them in the grove, and there</l>
<l>My darling twined them in her hair.</l>
<l>The sun, the earth, the genial breeze</l>
<l><q rend="post">Have spared these flowers my soul to please.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to that woody hill he prayed,</l>
<l>Whence flashed afar each wild cascade:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O best of mountains, hast thou seen</q></l>
<l>A dame of perfect form and mien</l>
<l>In some sweet spot with trees o'ergrown,—</l>
<l><q rend="post">My darling whom I left alone?</q></l>
<l>Then as a lion threats a deer</l>
<l>He thundered with a voice of fear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Reveal her, mountain, to my view</q></l>
<l>With golden limbs and golden hue.</l>
<l>Where is my darling Sítá? speak</l>
<l><q rend="post">Before I rend thee peak from peak.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mountain seemed her track to show,</l>
<l>But told not all he sought to know.</l>
<l>Then Daśaratha's son renewed</l>
<l>His summons as the mount he viewed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Soon as my flaming arrows fly,</q></l>
<l>Consumed to ashes shall thou lie</l>
<l>Without a herb or bud or tree,</l>
<l>And birds no more shall dwell in thee.</l>
<l>And if this stream my prayer deny,</l>
<l>My wrath this day her flood shall dry,</l>
<l>Because she lends no aid to trace</l>
<l><q rend="post">My darling of the lotus face.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma spake as though his ire</l>
<l>Would scorch them with his glance of fire;</l>
<l>Then searching farther on the ground</l>
<l>The footprint of a fiend he found,</l>
<l>And small light traces here and there,</l>
<l>Where Sítá in her great despair,</l>
<l>Shrieking for Ráma's help, had fled</l>
<l>Before the giant's mighty tread.</l>
<l>His careful eye each trace surveyed</l>
<l>Which Sítá and the fiend had made,—</l>
<l>The quivers and the broken bow</l>
<l>And ruined chariot of the foe,—</l>
<l>And told, distraught by fear and grief,</l>
<l>His tidings to his brother chief:</l>
<l><q>O Lakshmaṇ, here,</q> he cried <q rend="pre">behold</q></l>
<l>My Sítá's earrings dropped with gold.</l>
<l>Here lie her garlands torn and rent,</l>
<l>Here lies each glittering ornament.</l>
<l>O look, the ground on every side</l>
<l>With blood-like drops of gold is dyed.</l>
<l>The fiends who wear each strange disguise</l>
<l>Have seized, I ween, the helpless prize.</l>
<l>My lady, by their hands o'erpowered,</l>
<l>Is slaughtered, mangled, and devoured.</l>
<l>Methinks two fearful giants came</l>
<l>And waged fierce battle for the dame.</l>
<l>Whose, Lakshmaṇ, was this mighty bow</l>
<l>With pearls and gems in glittering row?</l>
<l>Cast to the ground the fragments lie,</l>
<l>And still their glory charms the eye.</l>
<l>A bow so mighty sure was planned</l>
<l>For heavenly God or giant's hand.</l>
<l>Whose was this coat of golden mail</l>
<l>Which, though its lustre now is pale,</l>
<l>Shone like the sun of morning, bright</l>
<l>With studs of glittering lazulite?</l>
<l>Whose, Lakshmaṇ, was this bloom-wreathed shade</l>
<l>With all its hundred ribs displayed?</l>
<l>This screen, most meet for royal brow,</l>
<l>With broken staff lies useless now.</l>
<l>And these tall asses, goblin-faced,</l>
<l>With plates of golden harness graced,</l>
<l>Whose hideous forms are stained with gore</l>
<l>Who is the lord whose yoke they bore?</l>
<l>Whose was this pierced and broken car</l>
<l>That shoots a flame-like blaze afar?</l>
<l>Whose these spent shafts at random spread,</l>
<l>Each fearful with its iron head,—</l>
<l>With golden mountings fair to see,</l>
<l>Long as a chariot's axle-tree?</l>
<l>These quivers see, which, rent in twain,</l>
<l>Their sheaves of arrows still contain.</l>
<l>Whose was this driver? Dead and cold,</l>
<l>His hands the whip and reins still hold.</l>
<l>See, Lakshmaṇ, here the foot I trace</l>
<l>Of man, nay, one of giant race.</l>
<l>The hatred that I nursed of old</l>
<l>Grows mightier now a hundred fold</l>
<l>Against these giants, fierce of heart,</l>
<l>Who change their forms by magic art.</l>
<l>Slain, eaten by the giant press,</l>
<l>Or stolen is the votaress,</l>
<l>Nor could her virtue bring defence</l>
<l>To Sítá seized and hurried hence.</l>
<l>O, if my love be slain or lost</l>
<l>All hope of bliss for me is crossed.</l>
<l>The power of all the worlds were vain</l>
<l>To bring one joy to soothe my pain.</l>
<l>The spirits with their blinded eyes</l>
<l>Would look in wonder, and despise</l>
<l>The Lord who made the worlds, the great</l>

<l>As the great sun leaps up the sky,</l>

<lg>
<l>He stood incensed with eyes of flame,</l>
<l>Still mourning for his ravished dame,</l>
<l>Determined, like the fire of Fate,</l>
<l>To leave the wide world desolate.</l>
<l>His ready bow the hero eyed,</l>
<l>And as again, again he sighed,</l>
<l>The triple world would fain consume</l>
<l>Like Hara<note place="foot">Śiva.</note> in the day of doom.</l>
<l>Then Lakshmaṇ moved with sorrow viewed</l>
<l>His brother in unwonted mood,</l>
<l>And reverent palm to palm applied,</l>
<l>Thus spoke with lips which terror dried</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thy heart was ever soft and kind,</q></l>

<l>Is thine eternal attribute.</l>
<l>O, let not, for the sin of one,</l>

<l>I know not whose this car that lies</l>

<l>Or whose the hand that plied the steel</l>
<l>Which left this spot, the battle o'er,</l>
<l>Thus sadly dyed with drops of gore.</l>
<l>Searching with utmost care I view</l>
<l>The signs of one and not of two.</l>
<l>Where'er I turn mine eyes I trace</l>
<l>No mighty host about the place.</l>
<l>Then mete not out for one offence</l>
<l>This all-involving recompense.</l>
<l>For kings should use the sword they bear,</l>
<l>But mild in time should learn to spare,</l>
<l>Thou, ever moved by misery's call,</l>

<l>Throughout this world who would not blame</l>
<l>This outrage on thy ravished dame?</l>
<l>Gandharvas, Dánavs, Gods, the trees,</l>
<l>The rocks, the rivers, and the seas,</l>
<l>Can ne'er in aught thy soul offend,</l>
<l>As one whom holiest rites befriend.</l>
<l>But him who dared to steal the dame</l>
<l>Pursue, O King, with ceaseless aim,</l>
<l>With me, the hermits' holy band,</l>
<l>And thy great bow to arm thy hand</l>
<l>By every mighty flood we'll seek,</l>

<l>Then, royal lord of Kośal's land,</l>
<l>No longer hold thy vengeful hand.</l>
<l>If meekness, prayer, and right be weak</l>
<l>To bring thee back the dame we seek,</l>
<l>Up, brother, with a deadly shower</l>

<lg>
<l>As Ráma viewed with heart-felt pain</l>
<l>The vulture whom the fiend had slain,</l>
<l>In words with tender love impressed</l>
<l>His brother chief he thus addressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">This royal bird with faithful thought</q></l>
<l>For my advantage strove and fought.</l>
<l>Slain by the fiend in mortal strife</l>
<l>For me he yields his noble life.</l>
<l>See, Lakshmaṇ, how his wounds have bled;</l>
<l>His struggling breath will soon have fled.</l>
<l>Faint is his voice, and near to die,</l>
<l>He scarce can lift his trembling eye.</l>
<l>Jaṭáyus, if thou still can speak,</l>
<l>Give, give the answer that I seek.</l>
<l>The fate of ravished Sítá tell,</l>
<l>And how thy mournful chance befell.</l>
<l>Say why the giant stole my dame:</l>
<l>What have I done that he could blame?</l>
<l>What fault in me has Rávaṇ seen</l>
<l>That he should rob me of my queen?</l>
<l>How looked the lady's moon-bright cheek?</l>
<l>What were the words she found to speak?</l>
<l>His strength, his might, his deeds declare:</l>
<l>And tell the form he loves to wear.</l>
<l>To all my questions make reply:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Where does the giant's dwelling lie?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The noble bird his glances bent</l>
<l>On Ráma as he made lament,</l>
<l>And in low accents faint and weak</l>
<l>With anguish thus began to speak:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Fierce Rávaṇ, king of giant race,</q></l>
<l>Stole Sítá from thy dwelling-place.</l>
<l>He calls his magic art to aid</l>
<l>With wind and cloud and gloomy shade.</l>
<l>When in the fight my power was spent</l>
<l>My wearied wings he cleft and rent.</l>
<l>Then round the dame his arms he threw,</l>
<l>And to the southern region flew.</l>
<l>O Raghu's son, I gasp for breath,</l>
<l>My swimming sight is dim in death.</l>
<l>E'en now before my vision pass</l>
<l>Bright trees of gold with hair of grass,</l>
<l>The hour the impious robber chose</l>
<l>Brings on the thief a flood of woes.</l>
<l>The giant in his haste forgot</l>
<l>'Twas Vinda's hour,<note place="foot">From the root <hi rend='italic'>vid</hi>,
to find.</note> or heeded not.</l>
<l>Those robbed at such a time obtain</l>
<l>Their plundered store and wealth again.</l>
<l>He, like a fish that takes the bait,</l>
<l>In briefest time shall meet his fate.</l>
<l>Now be thy troubled heart controlled</l>
<l>And for thy lady's loss consoled,</l>
<l>For thou wilt slay the fiend in fight</l>
<l><q rend="post">And with thy dame have new delight.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With senses clear, though sorely tried,</l>
<l>The royal vulture thus replied,</l>
<l>While as he sank beneath his pain</l>
<l>Forth rushed the tide of blood again.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Him,<note place="foot">Rávaṇ.</note> brother of the Lord of Gold,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Viśravas' self begot of old.</q></l>
<l>Thus spoke the bird, and stained with gore</l>
<l>Resigned the breath that came no more.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q>Speak, speak again!</q> thus Ráma cried,</l>
<l>With reverent palm to palm applied,</l>
<l>But from the frame the spirit fled</l>
<l>And to the skiey regions sped.</l>
<l>The breath of life had passed away.</l>
<l>Stretched on the ground the body lay.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Ráma saw the vulture lie,</l>
<l>Huge as a hill, with darksome eye,</l>
<l>With many a poignant woe distressed</l>
<l>His brother chief he thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Amid these haunted shades content</q></l>
<l>Full many a year this bird has spent.</l>
<l>His life in home of giants passed,</l>
<l>In Daṇḍak wood he dies at last.</l>
<l>The years in lengthened course have fled</l>
<l>Untroubled o'er the vulture's head,</l>
<l>And now he lies in death, for none</l>
<l>The stern decrees of Fate may shun.</l>
<l>See, Lakshmaṇ, how the vulture fell</l>
<l>While for my sake he battled well.</l>
<l>And strove to free with onset bold</l>
<l>My Sítá from the giant's hold.</l>
<l>Supreme amid the vulture kind</l>
<l>His ancient rule the bird resigned,</l>
<l>And conquered in the fruitless strife</l>
<l>Gave for my sake his noble life.</l>
<l>O Lakshmaṇ, many a time we see</l>
<l>Great souls who keep the law's decree,</l>
<l>With whom the weak sure refuge find,</l>
<l>In creatures of inferior kind.</l>
<l>The loss of her, my darling queen,</l>
<l>Strikes with a pang less fiercely keen</l>
<l>Than now this slaughtered bird to see</l>
<l>Who nobly fought and died for me.</l>
<l>As Daśaratha, good and great,</l>
<l>Was glorious in his high estate,</l>
<l>Honoured by all, to all endeared,</l>
<l>So was this royal bird revered.</l>
<l>Bring fuel for the funeral rite:</l>
<l>These hands the solemn fire shall light</l>
<pb n="310"/><anchor id="Pg310"/>
<l>And on the burning pyre shall lay</l>
<l>The bird who died for me to-day.</l>
<l>Now on the gathered wood shall lie</l>
<l>The lord of all the birds that fly,</l>
<l>And I will burn with honours due</l>
<l>My champion whom the giant slew.</l>
<l>O royal bird of noblest heart,</l>
<l>Graced with all funeral rites depart</l>
<l>To bright celestial seats above,</l>
<l>Rewarded for thy faithful love.</l>
<l>Dwell in thy happy home with those</l>
<l>Whose constant fires of worship rose.</l>
<l>Live blest amid the unyielding brave,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And those who land in largess gave.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sore grief upon his bosom weighed</l>
<l>As on the pyre the bird he laid,</l>
<l>And bade the kindled flame ascend</l>
<l>To burn the body of his friend.</l>
<l>Then with his brother by his side</l>
<l>The hero to the forest hied.</l>
<l>There many a stately deer he slew,</l>
<l>The flesh around the bird to strew.</l>
<l>The venison into balls he made,</l>
<l>And on fair grass before him laid.</l>
<l>Then that the parted soul might rise</l>
<l>And find free passage to the skies,</l>
<l>Each solemn word and text he said</l>
<l>Which Bráhmans utter o'er the dead.</l>
<l>Then hastening went the princely pair</l>
<l>To bright Godávarí, and there</l>
<l>Libations of the stream they poured</l>
<l>In honour of the vulture lord,</l>
<l>With solemn ritual to the slain,</l>
<l>As scripture's holy texts ordain.</l>
<l>Thus offerings to the bird they gave</l>
<l>And bathed their bodies in the wave.</l>

<lg>
<l>When every rite was duly paid</l>
<l>The princely brothers onward strayed,</l>
<l>And eager in the lady's quest</l>
<l>They turned their footsteps to the west.</l>
<l>Through lonely woods that round them lay</l>
<l>Ikshváku's children made their way,</l>
<l>And armed with bow and shaft and brand</l>
<l>Pressed onward to the southern land.</l>
<l>Thick trees and shrubs and creepers grew</l>
<l>In the wild grove they hurried through.</l>
<l>'Twas dark and drear and hard to pass</l>
<l>For tangled thorns and matted grass.</l>
<l>Still onward with a southern course</l>
<l>They made their way with vigorous force,</l>
<l>And passing through the mazes stood</l>
<l>Beyond that vast and fearful wood.</l>
<l>With toil and hardship yet unspent</l>
<l>Three leagues from Janasthán they went,</l>
<l>And speeding on their way at last</l>
<l>Within the wood of Krauncha<note place="foot">Or Curlews' Wood.</note> passed:</l>
<l>A fearful forest wild and black</l>
<l>As some huge pile of cloudy rack,</l>
<l>Filled with all birds and beasts, where grew</l>
<l>Bright blooms of every varied hue.</l>
<l>On Sítá bending every thought</l>
<l>Through all the mighty wood they sought,</l>
<l>And at the lady's loss dismayed</l>
<l>Here for a while and there they stayed.</l>
<l>Then turning farther eastward they</l>
<l>Pursued three leagues their weary way,</l>
<l>Passed Krauncha's wood and reached the grove</l>
<l>Where elephants rejoiced to rove.</l>
<l>The chiefs that awful wood surveyed</l>
<l>Where deer and wild birds filled each glade,</l>
<l>Where scarce a step the foot could take</l>
<l>For tangled shrub and tree and brake.</l>
<l>There in a mountain's woody side</l>
<l>A cave the royal brothers spied,</l>
<l>With dread abysses deep as hell,</l>
<l>Where darkness never ceased to dwell.</l>
<l>When, pressing on, the lords of men</l>
<l>Stood near the entrance of the den,</l>
<l>They saw within the dark recess</l>
<l>A huge misshapen giantess;</l>
<l>A thing the timid heart that shook</l>
<l>With fearful shape and savage look.</l>
<l>Terrific fiend, her voice was fierce,</l>
<l>Long were her teeth to rend and pierce.</l>
<l>The monster gorged her horrid feast</l>
<l>Of flesh of many a savage beast,</l>
<l>While her long locks, at random flung,</l>
<l>Dishevelled o'er her shoulders hung.</l>
<l>Their eyes the royal brothers raised,</l>
<l>And on the fearful monster gazed.</l>
<l>Forth from her den she came and glanced</l>
<l>At Lakshmaṇ as he first advanced,</l>
<l>Her eager arms to hold him spread,</l>
<l>And <q>Come and be my love</q> she said,</l>
<l>Then as she held him to her breast,</l>
<l>The prince in words like these addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Behold thy treasure fond and fair:</q></l>
<l>Ayomukhi<note place="foot">Iron-faced.</note> the name I bear.</l>
<pb n="311"/><anchor id="Pg311"/>
<l>In thickets of each lofty hill,</l>
<l>On islets of each brook and rill,</l>
<l>With me delighted shalt thou play,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And live for many a lengthened day.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enraged he heard the monster woo;</l>
<l>His ready sword he swiftly drew,</l>
<l>And the sharp steel that quelled his foes</l>
<l>Cut through her breast and ear and nose.</l>
<l>Thus mangled by his vengeful sword</l>
<l>In rage and pain the demon roared,</l>
<l>And hideous with her awful face</l>
<l>Sped to her secret dwelling place.</l>
<l>Soon as the fiend had fled from sight,</l>
<l>The brothers, dauntless in their might,</l>
<l>Reached a wild forest dark and dread</l>
<l>Whose tangled ways were hard to tread.</l>
<l>Then bravest Lakshmaṇ, virtuous youth,</l>
<l>The friend of purity and truth,</l>
<l>With reverent palm to palm applied</l>
<l>Thus to his glorious brother cried:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">My arm presaging throbs amain,</q></l>
<l>My troubled heart is sick with pain,</l>
<l>And cheerless omens ill portend</l>
<l>Where'er my anxious eyes I bend.</l>
<l>Dear brother, hear my words: advance</l>
<l>Resolved and armed for every chance,</l>
<l>For every sign I mark to-day</l>
<l>Foretells a peril in the way.</l>
<l>This bird of most ill-omened note,</l>
<l>Loud screaming with discordant throat,</l>
<l>Announces with a warning cry</l>
<l><q rend="post">That strife and victory are nigh.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then as the chiefs their search pursued</l>
<l>Throughout the dreary solitude,</l>
<l>They heard amazed a mighty sound</l>
<l>That broke the very trees around,</l>
<l>As though a furious tempest passed</l>
<l>Crushing the wood beneath its blast.</l>
<l>Then Ráma raised his trusty sword,</l>
<l>And both the hidden cause explored.</l>
<l>There stood before their wondering eyes</l>
<l>A fiend broad-chested, huge of size.</l>
<l>A vast misshapen trunk they saw</l>
<l>In height surpassing nature's law.</l>
<l>It stood before them dire and dread</l>
<l>Without a neck, without a head.</l>
<l>Tall as some hill aloft in air,</l>
<l>Its limbs were clothed with bristling hair,</l>
<l>And deep below the monster's waist</l>
<l>His vast misshapen mouth was placed.</l>
<l>His form was huge, his voice was loud</l>
<l>As some dark-tinted thunder cloud.</l>
<l>Forth from his ample chest there came</l>
<l>A brilliance as of gushing flame.</l>
<l>Beneath long lashes, dark and keen</l>
<l>The monster's single eye was seen.</l>
<l>Deep in his chest, long, fiercely bright,</l>
<l>It glittered with terrific light.</l>
<l>He swallowed down his savage fare</l>
<l>Of lion, bird, and slaughtered bear,</l>
<l>And with huge teeth exposed to view</l>
<l>O'er his great lips his tongue he drew.</l>
<l>His arms unshapely, vast and dread,</l>
<l>A league in length, he raised and spread.</l>
<l>He seized with monstrous hands a herd</l>
<l>Of deer and many a bear and bird.</l>
<l>Among them all he picked and chose,</l>
<l>Drew forward these, rejected those.</l>
<l>Before the princely pair he stood</l>
<l>Barring their passage through the wood.</l>
<l>A league of shade the chiefs had passed</l>
<l>When on the fiend their eyes they cast.</l>
<l>A monstrous shape without a head</l>
<l>With mighty arms before him spread,</l>
<l>They saw that hideous trunk appear</l>
<l>That struck the trembling eye with fear.</l>
<l>Then, stretching to their full extent</l>
<l>His awful arms with fingers bent,</l>
<l>Round Raghu's princely sons he cast</l>
<l>Each grasping limb and held them fast.</l>
<l>Though strong of arm and fierce in fight,</l>
<l>Each armed with bow and sword to smite,</l>
<l>The royal brothers, brave and bold,</l>
<l>Were helpless in the giant's hold.</l>
<l>Then Raghu's son, heroic still,</l>
<l>Felt not a pang his bosom thrill;</l>
<l>But young, with no protection near,</l>
<l>His brother's heart was sad with fear,</l>
<l>And thus with trembling tongue he said</l>
<l>To Ráma, sore disquieted:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Ah me, ah me, my days are told:</q></l>
<l>O see me in the giant's hold.</l>
<l>Fly, son of Raghu, swiftly flee,</l>
<l>And thy dear self from danger free.</l>
<l>Me to the fiend an offering give;</l>
<l>Fly at thine ease thyself and live.</l>
<l>Thou, great Kakutstha's son, I ween,</l>
<l>Wilt find ere long thy Maithil queen,</l>

<l>Thine old hereditary reign,</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Brother, from causeless dread forbear.</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">A chief like thee should scorn despair.</q></l>

<l>Among the Dánavs<note place="foot">A class of mythological giants. In the

first and best,</l>
<l>The sons of Raghu thus addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What men are you, whose shoulders show</q></l>
<l>Broad as a bull's, with sword and bow,</l>
<l>Who roam this dark and horrid place,</l>
<l>Brought by your fate before my face?</l>

<l>These solitary wilds you tread,</l>

<l><q rend="post">Esteem your lives already lost.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The royal brothers heard with dread</l>
<l>The words which fierce Kabandha said.</l>
<l>And Ráma to his brother cried,</l>
<l>Whose cheek by blanching fear was dried:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Alas, we fall, O valiant chief,</q></l>
<l>From sorrow into direr grief,</l>
<l>Still mourning her I hold so dear</l>
<l>We see our own destruction near.</l>
<l>Mark, brother, mark what power has time</l>
<l>O'er all that live, in every clime.</l>
<l>Now, lord of men, thyself and me</l>
<l>Involved in fatal danger see.</l>
<l>'Tis not, be sure, the might of Fate</l>
<l>That crushes all with deadly weight.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l>Thus in calm strength which naught could shake</l>
<l>The son of Daśaratha spake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With glory yet unstained</l>
<l>Upon Sumitrá's son he bent</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Thou, whose delight is others' pain,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">This grisly form shalt still retain.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then when I prayed him to relent</l>
<l>And fix some term of punishment,—</l>
<l>Prayed that the curse at length might cease,</l>
<l>He bade me thus expect release:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Let Ráma cleave thine arms away</q></l>
<l>And on the pyre thy body lay,</l>
<l>And then shalt thou, set free from doom,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thine own fair shape once more assume.</q></l>
<l>O Lakshmaṇ, hear my words: in me</l>
<l>The world-illustrious Danu see.</l>
<l>By Indra's curse, subdued in fight,</l>
<l>I wear this form which scares the sight.</l>
<l>By sternest penance long maintained</l>
<l>The mighty Father's grace I gained.</l>
<l>When length of days the God bestowed,</l>
<l>With foolish pride my bosom glowed.</l>
<l>My life, of lengthened years assured,</l>
<l>I deemed from Śakra's might secured.</l>
<l>Let by my senseless pride astray</l>
<l>I challenged Indra to the fray.</l>
<l>A flaming bolt with many a knot</l>
<l>With his terrific arm he shot,</l>
<l>And straight my head and thighs compressed</l>
<l>Were buried in my bulky chest.</l>
<l>Deaf to each prayer and piteous call</l>
<l>He sent me not to Yáma's hall.</l>
<l><q>Thy prayers and cries,</q> he said <q rend="pre">are vain:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The Father's word must true remain.</q></l>
<l><q rend="pre">But how may lengthened life be spent</q></l>
<l>By one the bolt has torn and rent?</l>
<l><q rend="post">How can I live,</q> I cried, <q rend="pre">unfed,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">With shattered face and thighs and head?</q></l>
<l>As thus I spoke his grace to crave,</l>
<l>Arms each a league in length he gave,</l>
<l>And opened in my chest beneath</l>
<l>This mouth supplied with fearful teeth.</l>
<l>So my huge arms I used to cast</l>
<l>Round woodland creatures as they passed,</l>
<l>And fed within the forest here</l>
<l>On lion, tiger, pard, and deer.</l>
<l>Then Indra spake to soothe my grief:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">When Ráma and his brother chief</q></l>
<l>From thy huge bulk those arms shall cleave,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Then shall the skies thy soul receive.</q></l>
<l>Disguised in this terrific shape</l>
<l>I let no woodland thing escape,</l>
<l>And still my longing soul was pleased</l>
<l>Whene'er my arms a victim seized,</l>
<l>For in these arms I fondly thought</l>
<l>Would Ráma's self at last be caught.</l>
<l>Thus hoping, toiling many a day</l>
<l>I yearned to cast my life away,</l>
<l>And here, my lord, thou standest now:</l>
<l>Blessings be thine! for none but thou</l>
<l>Could cleave my arms with trenchant stroke:</l>
<l>True are the words the hermit spoke.</l>
<l>Now let me, best of warriors, lend</l>
<l>My counsel, and thy plans befriend,</l>
<l>And aid thee with advice in turn</l>
<l><q rend="post">If thou with fire my corse wilt burn.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus the mighty Danu prayed</l>
<l>With offer of his friendly aid,</l>
<l>While Lakshmaṇ gazed with anxious eye,</l>
<l>The virtuous Ráma made reply:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Lakshmaṇ and I through forest shade</q></l>
<l>From Janasthán a while had strayed.</l>
<l>When none was near her, Rávaṇ came</l>
<l>And bore away my glorious dame,</l>
<l>The giant's form and size unknown,</l>
<l>I learn as yet his name alone.</l>
<l>Not yet the power and might we know</l>
<l>Or dwelling of the monstrous foe.</l>
<l>With none our helpless feet to guide</l>
<l>We wander here by sorrow tried.</l>
<l>Let pity move thee to requite</l>

<l>Who stole my spouse, his dwelling where.</l>
<l>O, if thou can, I pray thee say,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Danu had lent attentive ear</l>
<l>The words which Ráma spoke to hear,</l>
<l>And thus, a speaker skilled and tried,</l>
<l>To that great orator replied:</l>

<l>Who bore away the Maithil dame.</l>
<l>Cursed for my evil deeds I wore</l>
<l>A shape which all the worlds abhor.</l>
<l>Now ere with wearied steeds the sun</l>

<head>Canto LXXIII. Kabandha's Counsel.</head>

<lg>
<l>The monster ceased: the princely pair</l>
<l>Heard great Kabandha's eager prayer.</l>
<l>Within a mountain cave they sped,</l>
<l>Where kindled fire with care they fed.</l>
<l>Then Lakshmaṇ in his mighty hands</l>
<l>Brought ample store of lighted brands,</l>
<l>And to a pile of logs applied</l>
<l>The flame that ran from side to side.</l>
<l>The spreading glow with gentle force</l>
<l>Consumed Kabandha's mighty corse,</l>
<l>Till the unresting flames had drunk</l>
<l>The marrow of the monstrous trunk,</l>
<l>As balls of butter melt away</l>
<l>Amid the fires that o'er them play.</l>
<l>Then from the pyre, like flame that glows</l>
<l>Undimmed by cloudy smoke, he rose,</l>
<l>In garments pure of spot or speck,</l>
<l>A heavenly wreath about his neck.</l>
<l>Resplendent in his bright attire</l>
<l>He sprang exultant from the pyre.</l>
<l>While from neck, arm, and foot was sent</l>
<l>The flash of gold and ornament.</l>
<l>High on a chariot, bright of hue,</l>
<l>Which swans of fairest pinion drew,</l>
<l>He filled each region of the air</l>
<l>With splendid glow reflected there.</l>
<l>Then in the sky he stayed his car</l>
<l>And called to Ráma from afar:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Hear, chieftain, while my lips explain</q></l>
<l>The means to win thy spouse again.</l>
<l>Six plans, O prince, the wise pursue</l>
<l>To reach the aims we hold in view.<note place="foot">Peace, war, marching, halting,
sowing dissensions, and seeking protection.</note></l>
<l>When evils ripening sorely press</l>
<l>They load the wretch with new distress,</l>
<l>So thou and Lakshmaṇ, tried by woe,</l>
<l>Have felt at last a fiercer blow,</l>
<l>And plunged in bitterest grief to-day</l>
<l>Lament thy consort torn away.</l>
<l>There is no course but this: attend;</l>
<l>Make, best of friends, that chief thy friend.</l>
<l>Unless his prospering help thou gain</l>
<l>Thy plans and hopes must all be vain.</l>
<l>O Ráma, hear my words, and seek,</l>
<l>Sugríva, for of him I speak.</l>
<l>His brother Báli, Indra's son,</l>
<l>Expelled him when the fight was won.</l>
<l>With four great chieftains, faithful still,</l>
<l>He dwells on Rishyamúka's hill.—</l>

<l>Good, splendid, mighty, bold and brave,</l>

<l>In all thy search for Sítá he</l>
<l>Thy ready friend and help will be.</l>
<l>With him to aid thee in thy quest</l>
<l>Dismiss all sorrow from thy breast.</l>
<l>Time is a mighty power, and none</l>
<l>His fixed decree can change or shun.</l>
<l>So rich reward thy toil shall bless,</l>
<l>And naught can stay thy sure success.</l>
<l>Speed hence, O chief, without delay,</l>

<l>This hour thy footsteps onward bend,</l>

<head>Canto LXXIV. Kabandha's Death.</head>

<lg>
<l>When wise Kabandha thus had taught</l>
<l>The means to find the dame they sought,</l>
<l>And urged them onward in the quest,</l>
<l>He thus again the prince addressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">This path, O Raghu's son, pursue</q></l>
<l>Where those fair trees which charm the view,</l>
<l>Extending westward far away,</l>
<l>The glory of their bloom display,</l>
<l>Where their bright leaves Rose-apples show,</l>
<l>And the tall Jak and Mango grow.</l>
<l>Whene'er you will, those trees ascend,</l>
<l>Or the long branches shake and bend,</l>
<l>Their savoury fruit like Amrit eat,</l>
<l>Then onward speed with willing feet.</l>
<l>Beyond this shady forest, decked</l>
<l>With flowering trees, your course direct.</l>
<l>Another grove you then will find</l>
<l>With every joy to take the mind,</l>
<l>Like Nandan with its charms displayed,</l>
<l>Or Northern Kuru's blissful shade;</l>
<l>Where trees distil their balmy juice,</l>
<l>And fruit through all the year produce;</l>
<l>Where shades with seasons ever fair</l>
<l>With Chaitraratha may compare:</l>
<l>Where trees whose sprays with fruit are bowed</l>
<l>Rise like a mountain or a cloud.</l>
<l>There, when you list, from time to time,</l>
<l>The loaded trees may Lakshmaṇ climb,</l>
<l>Or from the shaken boughs supply</l>
<l>Sweet fruit that may with Amrit vie.</l>
<l>The onward path pursuing still</l>
<l>From wood to wood, from hill to hill,</l>
<l>Your happy eyes at length will rest</l>
<l>On Pampá's lotus-covered breast.</l>
<l>Her banks with gentle slope descend,</l>
<l>Nor stones nor weed the eyes offend,</l>
<l>And o'er smooth beds of silver sand</l>
<l>Lotus and lily blooms expand.</l>
<l>There swans and ducks and curlews play,</l>
<l>And keen-eyed ospreys watch their prey,</l>
<l>And from the limpid waves are heard</l>
<l>Glad notes of many a water-bird.</l>
<l>Untaught a deadly foe to fear</l>
<l>They fly not when a man is near,</l>
<l>And fat as balls of butter they</l>
<l>Will, when you list, your hunger stay.</l>
<l>Then Lakshmaṇ with his shafts will take</l>
<l>The fish that swim the brook and lake,</l>
<l>Remove each bone and scale and fin,</l>
<l>Or strip away the speckled skin,</l>
<l>And then on iron skewers broil</l>
<l>For thy repast the savoury spoil.</l>
<l>Thou on a heap of flowers shalt rest</l>
<l>And eat the meal his hands have dressed,</l>
<l>There shalt thou lie on Pampá's brink,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ's hand shall give thee drink,</l>
<l>Filling a lotus leaf with cool</l>
<l>Pure water from the crystal pool,</l>
<l>To which the opening blooms have lent</l>
<l>The riches of divinest scent.</l>
<l>Beside thee at the close of day</l>
<l>Will Lakshmaṇ through the woodland stray,</l>
<l>And show thee where the monkeys sleep</l>
<l>In caves beneath the mountain steep.</l>
<l>Loud-voiced as bulls they forth will burst</l>
<l>And seek the flood, oppressed by thirst;</l>
<l>Then rest a while, their wants supplied,</l>
<l>Their well-fed bands on Pampá's side.</l>
<l>Thou roving there at eve shalt see</l>
<l>Rich clusters hang on shrub and tree,</l>
<l>And Pampá flushed with roseate glow,</l>
<l>And at the view forget thy woe.</l>
<l>There shalt thou mark with strange delight</l>
<l>Each loveliest flower that blooms by night,</l>
<l>While lily buds that shrink from day</l>
<l>Their tender loveliness display.</l>
<l>In that far wild no hand but thine</l>
<l>Those peerless flowers in wreaths shall twine:</l>
<l>Immortal in their changeless pride,</l>
<l>Ne'er fade those blooms and ne'er are dried.</l>
<l>There erst on holy thoughts intent</l>
<l>Their days Matanga's pupils spent.</l>
<l>Once for their master food they sought,</l>
<l>And store of fruit and berries brought.</l>
<l>Then as they laboured through the dell</l>
<l>From limb and brow the heat-drops fell:</l>
<l>Thence sprang and bloomed those wondrous trees:</l>
<l>Such holy power have devotees.</l>
<l>Thus, from the hermits' heat-drops sprung,</l>

<l>But cross, O son of Raghu, o'er,</l>

<l>No wandering elephants invade</l>

<l>Fair as the blessed wood where rove</l>
<l>Immortal Gods, or Nandan's grove.</l>

<l>'Tis hard to climb that towering steep</l>

<l>But if a villain stained with crime</l>
<l>That holy hill presume to climb,</l>
<l>The giants in their fury sweep</l>
<l>From the hill top the wretch asleep.</l>
<l>There loud and long is heard the roar</l>
<l>Of elephants on Pampá's shore,</l>
<l>Who near Matanga's dwelling stray</l>
<l>And in those waters bathe and play.</l>
<l>A while they revel by the flood,</l>
<l>Their temples stained with streams like blood,</l>
<l>Then wander far away dispersed,</l>
<l>Dark as huge clouds before they burst.</l>
<l>But ere they part they drink their fill</l>
<l>Of bright pure water from the rill,</l>
<l>Delightful to the touch, where meet</l>
<l>Scents of all flowers divinely sweet,</l>
<l>Then speeding from the river side</l>

<l>Then bears and tigers shalt thou view</l>
<l>Whose soft skins show the sapphire's hue,</l>
<l>And silvan deer that wander nigh</l>

<l>High in that mountain's wooded side</l>

<l>When Śavarí had sought the skies</l>

<l>With four brave chiefs of Vánar race</l>
<l>Sugríva makes his dwelling-place.</l>

<l>Thus spake Sumitrá's son, and then</l>
<l>Forth from the grove the king of men</l>
<l>With his dear brother by his side</l>
<l>To Pampá's lucid waters hied.</l>
<l>He gazed upon the woods where grew</l>
<l>Trees rich in flowers of every hue.</l>
<l>From brake and dell on every side</l>
<l>The curlew and the peacock cried,</l>
<l>And flocks of screaming parrots made</l>

<l>His eager eyes, as on he went,</l>

<l>He stood upon the water's side</l>
<l>Which streams from distant hills supplied:</l>
<l>Matanga's name that water bore:</l>
<l>There bathed he from the shelving shore.</l>
<l>Then, each on earnest thoughts intent,</l>
<l>Still farther on their way they went.</l>

<l>Beneath his grief and wild dismay.</l>
<l>Before him lay the noble flood</l>
<l>Adorned with many a lotus bud.</l>
<l>On its fair banks Aśoka glowed,</l>
<l>And all bright trees their blossoms showed.</l>
<l>Green banks that silver waves confined</l>
<l>With lovely groves were fringed and lined.</l>
<l>The crystal waters in their flow</l>
<l>Showed level sands that gleamed below.</l>
<l>There glittering fish and tortoise played,</l>
<l>And bending trees gave pleasant shade.</l>
<l>There creepers on the branches hung</l>
<l>With lover-like embraces clung.</l>
<l>There gay Gandharvas loved to meet,</l>
<l>And Kinnars sought the calm retreat.</l>
<l>There wandering Yakshas found delight,</l>
<l>Snake-gods and rovers of the night.</l>
<l>Cool were the pleasant waters, gay</l>
<l>Each tree with creeper, flower, and spray.</l>
<l>There flushed the lotus darkly red,</l>
<l>Here their white glory lilies spread,</l>
<l>Here sweet buds showed their tints of blue:</l>
<l>So carpets gleam with many a hue.</l>
<l>A grove of Mangoes blossomed nigh,</l>
<l>Echoing with the peacock's cry.</l>
<l>When Ráma by his brother's side</l>
<l>The lovely flood of Pampá eyed,</l>
<l>Decked like a beauty, fair to see</l>
<l>With every charm of flower and tree,</l>
<l>His mighty heart with woe was rent</l>

<l>The princes stood by Pampá's side<note place="foot">Pampá is said by
the commentator to be the name both of a lake and a brook

<l>Bright Pampá and her forest show.</l>

<l>The lotuses in close array</l>
<l>Their passing loveliness display,</l>
<l>And pard and tiger, deer and snake</l>
<l>Haunt every glade and dell and brake.</l>
<l>Those grassy spots display the hue</l>
<l>Of topazes and sapphires' blue,</l>
<l>And, gay with flowers of every dye,</l>
<l>With richly broidered housings vie.</l>
<l>What loads of bloom the high trees crown,</l>

<l>High upon rock and table-land,</l>
<l>As the cool gales their branches bend,</l>
<l>Their floating blossoms downward send.</l>

<l>And sport in merry guise with all</l>
<l>The fallen blooms and those that fall.</l>
<l>See, brother, where the merry breeze</l>

<l>Ah me, Sumitrá's son, the spring</l>

<l>Wakes in my lonely breast the flame</l>
<l>Of sorrow as I mourn my dame.</l>
<l>Love strikes me through with darts of fire,</l>

<l>I hear the happy wild-cock call</l>
<l>Beside the shady waterfall.</l>
<l>His cry of joy afflicts my breast</l>
<l>By love's absorbing might possessed.</l>
<l>My darling from our cottage heard</l>
<l>One morn in spring this shrill-toned bird,</l>
<l>And called me in her joy to hear</l>
<l>The happy cry that charmed her ear.</l>
<l>See, birds of every varied voice</l>
<l>Around us in the woods rejoice,</l>
<l>On creeper, shrub, and plant alight,</l>
<l>Or wing from tree to tree their flight.</l>
<l>Each bird his kindly mate has found,</l>
<l>And loud their notes of triumph sound,</l>

<l>The blooms of bright Aśokas<note place="foot"><p><q rend="pre">The Jonesia Asoca is a
tree of considerable size, native of southern India.
It blossoms in February and March with large erect compact clusters of flowers,
varying in colour from pale-orange to scarlet, almost to be mistaken, on a hasty
glance, for immense trusses of bloom of an Ixora. Mr. Fortune considered this
tree, when in full bloom, superior in beauty even to the Amherstia.</q></p>
<p><q rend="post">The first time I saw the Asoc in flower was on the hill where the
famous rock-cut temple of Kárlí is situated, and a large concourse of natives had
assembled for the celebration of some Hindoo festival. Before proceeding to the temple
the Mahratta women gathered from two trees, which were flowering somewhat below,
each a fine truss of blossom, and inserted it in the hair at the back of her head.…
As they moved about in groups it is impossible to imagine a more delightful
effect than the rich scarlet bunches of flowers presented on their fine glossy jet-black
hair.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Firminger</hi>,

<l>Fanned by the charms the spring time shows,</l>

<l>Ah happy bird! no giant's hate</l>

<l>My widowed woe is hard to bear.</l>

<l>A thousand birds in wild delight</l>
<l>Their rapture-breathing notes unite;</l>
<l>Bird calls to bird in joyous strain,</l>
<l>And turns my love to frenzied pain.</l>
<l>O, if beneath those alien skies,</l>
<l>There be a spring where Sítá lies,</l>
<l>I know my prisoned love must be</l>
<l>Touched with like grief, and mourn with me.</l>
<l>But ah, methinks that dreary clime</l>
<l>Knows not the touch of spring's sweet time.</l>
<l>How could my black eyed love sustain,</l>
<l>Without her lord, so dire a pain?</l>
<l>Or if the sweet spring come to her</l>

<l>Ah, if the springtide's languor came</l>
<l>With soft enchantment o'er my dame,</l>
<l>My darling of the lotus eye,</l>
<l>My gently speaking love, would die;</l>
<l>For well my spirit knows that she</l>
<l>Can never live bereft of me</l>
<l>With love that never wavered yet</l>
<l>My Sítá's heart, on me is set,</l>
<l>Who, with a soul that ne'er can stray,</l>
<l>With equal love her love repay.</l>
<l>In vain, in vain the soft wind brings</l>
<l>Sweet blossoms on his balmy wings;</l>
<l>Delicious from his native snow,</l>
<l>To me like fire he seems to glow.</l>
<l>O, how I loved a breeze like this</l>
<l>When darling Sítá shared the bliss!</l>
<l>But now in vain for me it blows</l>
<l>To fan the fury of my woes.</l>

<l>But to my tortured memory rise</l>
<l>The glories of my darling's eyes.</l>
<l>Cool breezes through the forest stray</l>
<l>Gathering odours on their way,</l>
<l>Enriched with all the rifled scent</l>
<l>Of lotus flower and filament.</l>
<l>Their touch upon my temples falls</l>
<l>And Sítá's fragrant breath recalls.</l>
<l>Now look, dear brother, on the right</l>
<l>Of Pampá towers a mountain height</l>
<l>Where fairest Cassia trees unfold</l>
<l>The treasures of their burnished gold.</l>
<l>Proud mountain king! his woody side</l>
<l>With myriad ores is decked and dyed,</l>
<l>And as the wind-swept blossoms fall</l>
<l>Their fragrant dust is stained with all.</l>
<l>To yon high lands thy glances turn:</l>
<l>With pendent fire they flash and burn,</l>
<l>Where in their vernal glory blaze</l>
<l>Paláśa flowers on leafless sprays.</l>
<l>O Lakshmaṇ, look! on Pampá's side</l>
<l>What fair trees rise in blooming pride!</l>
<l>What climbing plants above them show</l>
<l>Or hang their flowery garlands low!</l>
<l>See how the amorous creeper rings</l>
<l>The wind-rocked trees to which she clings,</l>
<l>As though a dame by love impelled</l>
<l>With clasping arms her lover held.</l>
<l>Drunk with the varied scents that fill</l>
<l>The balmy air, from hill to hill,</l>
<l>From grove to grove, from tree to tree,</l>
<l>The joyous wind is wandering free.</l>
<l>These gay trees wave their branches bent</l>
<l>By blooms, of honey redolent.</l>
<l>There, slowly opening to the day,</l>
<l>Buds with dark lustre deck the spray.</l>
<l>The wild bee rests a moment where</l>
<l>Each tempting flower is sweet and fair,</l>
<l>Then, coloured by the pollen dyes,</l>
<l>Deep in some odorous blossom lies.</l>
<l>Soon from his couch away he springs:</l>
<l>To other trees his course he wings,</l>
<l>And tastes the honeyed blooms that grow</l>
<l>Where Pampá's lucid waters flow.</l>
<l>See, Lakshmaṇ, see, how thickly spread</l>
<l>With blossoms from the trees o'erhead,</l>
<l>That grass the weary traveller woos</l>
<l>With couches of a thousand hues,</l>
<l>And beds on every height arrayed</l>
<l>With red and yellow tints are laid,</l>
<l>No longer winter chills the earth:</l>
<l>A thousand flowerets spring to birth,</l>
<l>And trees in rivalry assume</l>
<l>Their vernal garb of bud and bloom.</l>
<l>How fair they look, how bright and gay</l>
<l>With tasselled flowers on every spray!</l>
<l>While each to each proud challenge flings</l>
<l>Borne in the song the wild bee sings.</l>
<l>That mallard by the river edge</l>
<l>Has bathed amid the reeds and sedge:</l>
<l>Now with his mate he fondly plays</l>
<l>And fires my bosom as I gaze.</l>

<l>'Twas she I saw: my heart infers</l>
<l>That shrinking form was doubtless hers,</l>
<l>Which gaint Rávaṇ, fierce and dread,</l>

<l>Like helpless queen of serpent race,<note place="foot">Like the wife of a Nága or

<l>High on a hill she saw me stand</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma spoke. Sugríva hied</l>

<l>In Ráma's hand with friendly haste</l>
<l>The jewels and the robe he placed.</l>
<l>Then, like the moon by mist assailed,</l>
<l>The tear-dimmed eyes of Ráma failed;</l>
<l>That burst of woe unmanned his frame,</l>
<l>Woe sprung from passion for his dame,</l>
<l>And with his manly strength o'erthrown,</l>
<l>He fell and cried, Ah me! mine own!</l>
<l>Again, again close to his breast</l>
<l>The ornaments and robe he pressed,</l>
<l>While the quick pants that shook his frame</l>
<l>As from a furious serpent came.</l>
<l>On his dear brother standing nigh</l>

<l>In bitter wail he thus began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Look, brother, and behold once more</q></l>
<l>The ornaments and robe she wore,</l>
<l>Dropped while the giant bore away</l>
<l>In cruel arras his struggling prey,</l>
<l>Dropped in some quiet spot, I ween,</l>
<l>Where the young grass was soft and green;</l>
<l>For still untouched by spot or stain</l>
<l><q rend="post">Their former beauty all retain.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke with many a tear and sigh,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">O Raghu's son, I cannot tell</q></l>
<l>Where now that cruel fiend may dwell,</l>
<l>Declare his power and might, or trace</l>
<l>The author of his cursed race.</l>
<l>Still trust the promise that I make</l>
<l>And let thy breast no longer ache.</l>
<l>So will I toil, nor toil in vain,</l>
<l>That thou thy consort mayst regain.</l>
<l>So will I work with might and skill</l>
<l>That joy anew thy heart shall fill:</l>
<l>The valour of my soul display,</l>

<l>Like troubles, too, mine eyes have seen,</l>
<l>Lamenting for a long-lost queen;</l>
<l>But, by despair unconquered yet,</l>
<l>My strength of mind I ne'er forget.</l>
<l>Far more shouldst thou of lofty soul</l>
<l>Thy passion and thy tears control,</l>
<l>When I, of Vánar's humbler strain,</l>
<l>Weep not for her in ceaseless pain.</l>
<l>Be firm, be patient, nor forget</l>
<l>The bounds the brave of heart have set</l>
<l>In loss, in woe, in strife, in fear,</l>
<l>When the dark hour of death is near.</l>

<l>See, suppliant hand to hand I lay,</l>
<l>And, moved by faithful love, I pray.</l>
<l>Give way no more to grief and gloom,</l>
<l>But all thy native strength resume.</l>
<l>No joy on earth, I ween, have they</l>
<l>Who yield their souls to sorrow's sway.</l>
<l>Their glory fades in slow decline:</l>
<l>'Tis not for thee to grieve and pine.</l>

<l>Taught by thy counsel, O my lord,</l>
<l>I feel my native strength restored.</l>
<l>A friend like thee is hard to gain,</l>
<l>Most rare in time of grief and pain.</l>
<l>Now strain thine utmost power to trace</l>
<l>The Maithil lady's dwelling place,</l>
<l>And aid me in my search to find</l>
<l>Fierce Rávaṇ of the impious mind.</l>
<l>Trust thou, in turn, thy loyal friend,</l>
<l>And say what aid this arm can lend</l>
<l>To speed thy hopes, as fostering rain</l>
<l>Quickens in earth the scattered grain.</l>
<l>Deem not those words, that seemed to spring</l>

<l>And turned his rapid eye to view</l>
<l>The forest trees that near him grew.</l>
<l>He saw, not far from where he stood,</l>
<l>A Sál tree towering o'er the wood.</l>
<l>Amid the thick leaves many a bee</l>
<l>Graced the scant blossoms of the tree,</l>
<l>From whose dark shade a bough, that bore</l>
<l>A load of leafy twigs, he tore,</l>
<l>Which on the grassy ground he laid</l>

<l>Hanúmán saw them sit, he sought</l>

<l>There on the noble mountain's brow,</l>

<l>Sugríva's heart with rapture swelled,</l>

<l>And, shouting through the shades of night,</l>
<l>Challenged his foeman to the fight.</l>
<l>My brother heard the furious shout,</l>
<l>And wild with rage rushed madly out,</l>
<l>Though fain would I and each sad wife</l>
<l>Detain him from the deadly strife.</l>
<l>He burned his demon foe to slay,</l>
<l>And rushed impetuous to the fray.</l>
<l>His weeping wives he thrust aside,</l>
<l>And forth, impelled by fury, hied;</l>
<l>While, by my love and duty led,</l>
<l>I followed where my brother sped.</l>
<l>Máyáví looked, and at the sight</l>
<l>Fled from his foes in wild affright.</l>
<l>The flying fiend we quickly viewed,</l>
<l>And with swift feet his steps pursued.</l>
<l>Then rose the moon, whose friendly ray</l>
<l>Cast light upon our headlong way.</l>
<l>By the soft beams was dimly shown</l>
<l>A mighty cave with grass o'ergrown.</l>
<l>Within its depths he sprang, and we</l>
<l>The demon's form no more might see.</l>
<l>My brother's breast was all aglow</l>
<l>With fury when he missed the foe,</l>
<l>And, turning, thus to me he said</l>
<l>With senses all disquieted:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Here by the cavern's mouth remain;</q></l>
<l>Keep ear and eye upon the strain,</l>
<l>While I the dark recess explore</l>
<l><q rend="post">And dip my brand in foeman's gore.</q></l>
<l>I heard his angry speech, and tried</l>
<l>To turn him from his plan aside.</l>
<l>He made me swear by both his feet,</l>
<l>And sped within the dark retreat.</l>
<l>While in the cave he stayed, and I</l>
<l>Watched at the mouth, a year went by.</l>
<l>For his return I looked in vain,</l>
<l>And, moved by love, believed him slain.</l>
<l>I mourned, by doubt and fear distressed,</l>
<l>And greater horror seized my breast</l>
<l>When from the cavern rolled a flood,</l>
<l>A carnage stream of froth and blood;</l>
<l>And from the depths a sound of fear,</l>
<l>The roar of demons, smote mine ear;</l>
<l>But never rang my brother's shout</l>
<l>Triumphant in the battle rout.</l>
<l>I closed the cavern with a block,</l>
<l>Huge as a hill, of shattered rock.</l>
<l>Gave offerings due to Báli's shade,</l>
<l>And sought Kishkindhá, sore dismayed.</l>
<l>Long time with anxious care I tried</l>
<l>From Báli's lords his fate to hide,</l>
<l>But they, when once the tale was known,</l>

<l>And let the chouries,<note place="foot">Whisks made of the hair of the Yak

<l>Wave glorious o'er the rightful lord.</l>
<l>I kept my watch, thy word obeyed,</l>
<l>And by the cave a year I stayed.</l>
<l>But when I saw that stream of blood</l>
<l>Rush from the cavern in a flood,</l>
<l>My sad heart broken with dismay,</l>
<l>And every wandering sense astray,</l>
<l>I barred the entrance with a stone,—</l>
<l>A crag from some high mountain thrown—</l>
<l>Turned from the spot I watched in vain,</l>
<l>And to Kishkindhá came again.</l>
<l>My deep distress and downcast mien</l>
<l>By citizen and lord were seen.</l>
<l>They made me king against my will:</l>
<l>Forgive me if the deed was ill.</l>
<l>True as I ever was I see</l>
<l>My honoured king once more in thee;</l>
<l>I only ruled a while the state</l>
<l>When thou hadst left us desolate.</l>
<l>This town with people, lords, and lands,</l>
<l>Lay as a trust in guardian hands:</l>
<l>And now, my gracious lord, accept</l>
<l>The kingdom which thy servant kept.</l>
<l>Forgive me, victor of the foe,</l>
<l>Nor let thy wrath against me glow.</l>
<l>See joining suppliant hands I pray,</l>
<l>And at thy feet my head I lay.</l>
<l>Believe my words: against my will</l>
<l>The royal seat they made me fill.</l>
<l>Unkinged they saw the city, hence</l>
<l><q rend="post">They made me lord for her defence.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Báli, though I humbly sued,</l>
<l>Reviled me in his furious mood:</l>
<l><q>Out on thee, wretch!</q> in wrath he cried</l>
<l>With many a bitter taunt beside.</l>
<l>He summoned every lord, and all</l>
<l>His subjects gathered at his call.</l>
<l>Then forth his burning anger broke,</l>
<l>And thus amid his friends he spoke:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I need not tell, for well ye know,</q></l>
<l>How fierce Máyáví, fiend and foe,</l>
<l>Came to Kishkindhá's gate by night,</l>
<l>And dared me in his wrath to fight.</l>
<l>I heard each word the demon said:</l>
<l>Forth from my royal hall I sped;</l>
<l>And, foe in brother's guise concealed,</l>
<l>Sugríva followed to the field.</l>
<l>The mighty demon through the shade</l>
<l>Beheld me come with one to aid:</l>
<l>Then shrinking from unequal fight,</l>
<l>He turned his back in swiftest flight.</l>
<l>From vengeful foes his life to save</l>
<l>He sought the refuge of a cave.</l>
<l>Then when I saw the fiend had fled</l>
<l>Within that cavern dark and dread,</l>
<l>Thus to my brother cruel-eyed,</l>
<l>Impatient in my wrath, I cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I seek no more my royal town</q></l>
<l>Till I have struck the demon down.</l>
<l>Here by the cavern's mouth remain</l>
<l><q rend="post">Until my hand the foe have slain.</q></l>
<l>Upon his faith my heart relied,</l>
<l>And swift within the depths I hied.</l>
<l>A year went by: in every spot</l>
<l>I sought the fiend, but found him not.</l>
<l>At length my foe I saw and slew,</l>
<l>Whom long I feared when lost to view;</l>
<l>And all his kinsmen by his side</l>
<l>Beneath my vengeful fury died.</l>
<l>The monster, as he reeled and fell,</l>
<l>Poured forth his blood with roar and yell;</l>
<l>And, filling all the cavern, dyed</l>
<l>The portal with the crimson tide.</l>
<l>Upon my foeman slain at last</l>
<l>One look, one pitying look, I cast.</l>
<l>I sought again the light of day:</l>
<l>The cave was closed and left no way.</l>
<l>To the barred mouth I sadly came,</l>
<l>And called aloud Sugríva's name.</l>
<l>But all was still: no voice replied,</l>
<pb n="335"/><anchor id="Pg335"/>
<l>And hope within my bosom died.</l>
<l>With furious efforts, vain at first,</l>
<l>Through bars of rock my way I burst.</l>
<l>Then, free once more, the path that brought</l>
<l>My feet in safety home I sought.</l>
<l>'Twas thus Sugríva dared despise</l>
<l>The claim of brothers' friendly ties.</l>
<l>With crags of rock he barred me in,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And for himself the realm would win.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Báli spoke in words severe;</l>
<l>And then, unmoved by ruth or fear,</l>
<l>Left me a single robe and sent</l>
<l>His brother forth in banishment.</l>
<l>He cast me out with scathe and scorn,</l>
<l>And from my side my wife was torn.</l>
<l>Now in great fear and ill at ease</l>
<l>I roam this land with woods and seas,</l>
<l>Or dwell on Rishyamúka's hill,</l>
<l>And sorrow for my consort still.</l>
<l>Thou hast the tale how first arose</l>
<l>This bitter hate of brother foes.</l>
<l>Such are the griefs neath which I pine,</l>

<l>He spoke: Himálaya, skilled in lore</l>

<l>He listened to the Lord of Snow,</l>

<l>With pointed horns to strike and gore</l>
<l>The semblance of a bull he bore,</l>
<l>Huge as a cloud that downward bends</l>
<l>Ere the full flood of rain descends.</l>
<l>Impelled by pride and rage and hate,</l>
<l>He thundered at Kishkindhá's gate;</l>
<l>And with his bellowing, like the sound</l>
<l>Of pealing drums, he shook the ground,</l>
<l>He rent the earth and prostrate threw</l>
<l>The trees that near the portal grew.</l>
<l>King Báli from the bowers within</l>
<l>Indignant heard the roar and din.</l>
<l>Then, moonlike mid the stars, with all</l>
<l>His dames he hurried to the wall;</l>
<l>And to the fiend this speech, expressed</l>
<l>In clear and measured words, addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Know me for monarch. Báli styled,</q></l>
<l>Of Vánar tribes that roam the wild.</l>
<l>Say why dost thou this gate molest,</l>
<l>And bellowing thus disturb our rest?</l>
<l>I know thee, mighty fiend: beware</l>
<l><q rend="post">And guard thy life with wiser care.</q></l>
<l>He spoke: and thus the fiend returned,</l>
<l>While red with rage his eyeballs burned:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What! speak when all thy dames are nigh</q></l>
<l>And hero-like thy foe defy?</l>
<l>Come, meet me in the fight this day,</l>
<l>And learn my strength by bold assay.</l>
<l>Or shall I spare thee, and relent</l>
<l>Until the coming night be spent?</l>
<l>Take then the respite of a night</l>
<l>And yield thee to each soft delight.</l>
<l>Then, monarch of the Vánar race</l>
<l>With loving arms thy friends embrace.</l>
<l>Gifts on thy faithful lords bestow,</l>
<l>Bid each and all farewell, and go.</l>
<l>Show in the streets once more thy face,</l>
<l>Install thy son to fill thy place.</l>
<l>Dally a while with each dear dame;</l>
<l>And then my strength thy pride shall tame</l>
<l>For, should I smite thee drunk with wine</l>
<l>Enamoured of those dames of thine,</l>
<l>Beneath diseases bowed and bent,</l>
<l>Or weak, unarmed, or negligent,</l>
<l>My deed would merit hate and scorn</l>
<l><q rend="post">As his who slays the child unborn.</q></l>
<l>Then Báli's soul with rage was fired,</l>
<l>Queen Tára and the dames retired;</l>
<l>And slowly, with a laugh of pride,</l>
<l>The king of Vánars thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Me, fiend, thou deemest drunk with wine:</q></l>
<l>Unless thy fear the fight decline,</l>
<l>Come, meet me in the fray, and test</l>
<l><q rend="post">The spirit of my valiant breast.</q></l>
<l>He spoke in wrath and high disdain;</l>
<l>And, laying down his golden chain,</l>
<l>Gift of his sire Mahendra, dared</l>
<l>The demon, for the fray prepared;</l>
<l>Seized by the horns the monster, vast</l>
<l>As a huge hill, and held him fast,</l>
<l>Then fiercely dragged him round and round,</l>
<l>And, shouting, hurled him to the ground.</l>
<l>Blood streaming from his ears, he rose,</l>
<l>And wild with fury strove the foes.</l>
<l>Then Báli, match for Indra's might,</l>
<l>With every arm renewed the fight.</l>
<l>He fought with fists, and feet, and knees,</l>
<l>With fragments of the rock, and trees.</l>
<l>At last the monster's strength, assailed</l>
<l>By Śakra's<note place="foot">Another name of Indra or Mahendra.</note>
conquering offspring, failed.</l>
<l>Him Báli raised with mighty strain</l>
<l>And dashed upon the ground again;</l>
<l>Where, bruised and shattered, in a tide</l>
<l>Of rushing blood, the demon died.</l>
<l>King Báli saw the lifeless corse,</l>
<l>And bending, with tremendous force</l>
<l>Raised the huge bulk from where it lay,</l>
<l>And hurled it full a league away.</l>
<l>As through the air the body flew,</l>
<l>Some blood-drops, caught by gales that blew,</l>
<l>Welled from his shattered jaw and fell</l>
<l>By Saint Matanga's hermit cell:</l>
<l>Matanga saw, illustrious sage,</l>
<l>Those drops defile his hermitage,</l>
<pb n="337"/><anchor id="Pg337"/>
<l>And, as he marvelled whence they came,</l>
<l>Fierce anger filled his soul with flame:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Who is the villain, evil-souled,</q></l>
<l>With childish thoughts unwise and bold,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Who is the impious wretch,</q> he cried,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke Matanga in his rage,</l>
<l>And hastened from the hermitage,</l>
<l>When lo, before his wondering eyes</l>
<l>Lay the dead bull of mountain size.</l>
<l>His hermit soul was nothing slow</l>
<l>The doer of the deed to know,</l>
<l>And thus the Vánar in a burst</l>
<l>Of wild tempestuous wrath he cursed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ne'er let that Vánar wander here,</q></l>
<l>For, if he come, his death is near,</l>

<l>The holy place where I abide,</l>
<l>Who threw this demon corse and made</l>
<l>A ruin of the pleasant shade.</l>
<l>If e'er he plant his wicked feet</l>
<l>Within one league of my retreat;</l>
<l>Yea, if the villain come so nigh</l>
<l>That very hour he needs must die.</l>
<l>And let the Vánar lords who dwell</l>
<l>In the dark woods that skirt my cell</l>
<l>Obey my words, and speeding hence</l>
<l>Find them some meeter residence.</l>
<l>Here if they dare to stay, on all</l>
<l>The terrors of my curse shall fall.</l>
<l>They spoil the tender saplings, dear</l>

<l>Mar root and branch and leaf and spray,</l>
<l>And steal the ripening fruit away.</l>
<l>One day I grant, no further hour,</l>
<l>To-morrow shall my curse have power,</l>

<l><q rend="post">A stone through countless years shall be.</q></l>
<l>The Vánars heard the curse and hied</l>
<l>From sheltering wood and mountain side.</l>
<l>King Báli marked their haste and dread,</l>
<l>And to the flying leaders said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Speak, Vánar chiefs, and tell me why</q></l>
<l>From Saint Matanga's grove ye fly</l>
<l>To gather round me: is it well</l>
<l><q rend="post">With all who in those woodlands dwell?</q></l>
<l>He spoke: the Vánar leaders told</l>
<l>King Báli with his chain of gold</l>
<l>What curse the saint had on them laid,</l>
<l>Which drove them from their ancient shade.</l>
<l>Then royal Báli sought the sage,</l>
<l>With reverent hands to soothe his rage.</l>
<l>The holy man his suppliant spurned,</l>
<l>And to his cell in anger turned.</l>
<l>That curse on Báli sorely pressed,</l>
<l>And long his conscious soul distressed.</l>
<l>Him still the curse and terror keep</l>

<l>Look, Prince, before thee white and dry</l>

<l>Then Ráma, that his friend might know</l>
<l>His strength unrivalled, grasped his bow,</l>
<l>That mighty bow the foe's dismay,—</l>
<l>And on the string an arrow lay.</l>
<l>Next on the tree his eye he bent,</l>
<l>And forth the hurtling weapon went.</l>
<l>Loosed from the matchless hero's hold,</l>
<l>That arrow, decked with burning gold,</l>
<l>Cleft the seven palms in line, and through</l>
<l>The hill that rose behind them flew:</l>
<l>Six subterranean realms it passed,</l>
<l>And reached the lowest depth at last,</l>
<l>Whence speeding back through earth and air</l>
<l>It sought the quiver, and rested there.<note place="foot">The Bengal recension makes

<l>Upon the cloven trees amazed,</l>
<l>The sovereign of the Vánars gazed.</l>
<l>With all his chains and gold outspread</l>
<l>Prostrate on earth he laid his head.</l>
<l>Then, rising, palm to palm he laid</l>
<l>In reverent act, obeisance made,</l>
<l>And joyously to Ráma, best</l>
<l>Of war-trained chiefs, these words addressed:</l>

both worlds, numbers the very winkings of men's eyes, punishes transgressors whom
he seizes with his deadly noose, and pardons the sins of those who are penitent. In

<l>Sugríva's force now sank and broke,</l>
<l>Who, hoping naught from Ráma's aid,</l>
<l>To Rishyamúka fled dismayed,</l>

<l>His body bruised and dyed with gore,</l>

<head>Canto XIII. The Return To Kishkindhá.</head>

<lg>
<l>Thus with Sugríva, from the side</l>
<l>Of Rishyamúka, Ráma hied,</l>
<l>And stood before Kishkindhá's gate</l>
<l>Where Báli kept his regal state.</l>
<l>The hero in his warrior hold</l>
<l>Raised his great bow adorned with gold,</l>
<l>And drew his pointed arrow bright</l>
<l>As sunbeams, finisher of fight.</l>
<l>Strong-necked Sugríva led the way</l>
<l>With Lakshmaṇ mighty in the fray.</l>
<l>Nala and Níla came behind</l>
<l>With Hanumán of lofty mind,</l>
<l>And valiant Tára, last in place,</l>
<l>A leader of the Vánar race.</l>
<l>They gazed on many a tree that showed</l>
<l>The glory of its pendent load,</l>
<l>And brook and limpid rill that made</l>
<l>Sweet murmurs as they seaward strayed.</l>
<l>They looked on caverns dark and deep,</l>
<l>On bower and glen and mountain steep,</l>
<l>And saw the opening lotus stud</l>
<l>With roseate cup the crystal flood,</l>
<l>While crane and swan and coot and drake</l>
<l>Made pleasant music on the lake,</l>
<l>And from the reedy bank was heard</l>
<l>The note of many a happy bird.</l>
<l>In open lawns, in tangled ways,</l>
<l>They saw the tall deer stand at gaze,</l>
<l>Or marked them free and fearless roam,</l>
<l>Fed with sweet grass, their woodland home.</l>
<l>At times two flashing tusks between</l>
<l>The wavings of the wood were seen,</l>
<l>And some mad elephant, alone,</l>
<l>Like a huge moving hill, was shown.</l>
<l>And scarcely less in size appeared</l>
<l>Great monkeys all with dust besmeared.</l>
<l>And various birds that roam the skies,</l>
<l>And silvan creatures, met their eyes,</l>
<l>As through the wood the chieftains sped,</l>
<l>And followed where Sugríva led.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma, as their way they made,</l>
<l>Saw near at hand a lovely shade,</l>
<l>And, as he gazed upon the trees,</l>
<l>Spake to Sugríva words like these;</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Those stately trees in beauty rise,</q></l>
<l>Fair as a cloud in autumn skies.</l>
<l>I fain, my friend, would learn from thee</l>
<l><q rend="post">What pleasant grove is that I see.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma spake, the mighty souled;</l>
<l>And thus his tale Sugríva told:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">That, Ráma, is a wide retreat</q></l>
<l>That brings repose to weary feet.</l>
<l>Bright streams and fruit and roots are there,</l>
<l>And shady gardens passing fair.</l>
<l>There, neath the roof of hanging boughs,</l>
<l>The sacred Seven maintained their vows.</l>
<l>Their heads in dust were lowly laid,</l>
<l>In streams their nightly beds were made.</l>
<l>Each seventh night they broke their fast,</l>
<l>But air was still their sole repast,</l>
<l>And when seven hundred years were spent</l>
<l>To homes in heaven the hermits went.</l>
<l>Their glory keeps the garden yet,</l>
<l>With walls of stately trees beset.</l>
<l>Scarce would the Gods and demons dare,</l>
<l>By Indra led, to enter there.</l>
<l>No beast that roams the wood is found,</l>
<l>No bird of air, within the bound;</l>
<l>Or, thither if they idly stray,</l>
<l>They find no more their homeward way.</l>
<l>You hear at times mid dulcet tones</l>
<l>The chime of anklets, rings, and zones.</l>
<l>You hear the song and music sound,</l>
<l>And heavenly fragrance breathes around,</l>
<l>There duly burn the triple fires<note place="foot">Called respectively Gárhapatya,
Áhavaniya, and Dakshiṇa, household, sacrificial, and southern.</note></l>
<l>Where mounts the smoke in curling spires,</l>
<l>And, in a dun wreath, hangs above</l>
<l>The tall trees, like a brooding dove.</l>
<l>Round branch and crest the vapours close</l>
<l>Till every tree enveloped shows</l>
<l>A hill of lazulite when clouds</l>
<l>Hang round it with their misty shrouds.</l>
<l>With Lakshmaṇ, lord of Raghu's line,</l>
<l>In reverent guise thine head incline,</l>
<l>And with fixt heart and suppliant hand</l>
<l>Give honour to the sainted band.</l>
<l>They who with faithful hearts revere</l>
<l>The holy Seven who harboured here,</l>
<l>Shall never, son of Raghu, know</l>
<l><q rend="post">In all their lives an hour of woe.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma and his brother bent,</l>
<l>And did obeisance reverent</l>
<l>With suppliant hand and lowly head,</l>
<l>Then with Sugríva onward sped.</l>
<l>Beyond the sainted Seven's abode</l>
<l>Far on their way the chieftains strode,</l>
<l>And great Kishkindhá's portal gained,</l>
<l>The royal town where Báli reigned.</l>
<l>Then by the gate they took their stand</l>
<l>All ready armed a noble band,</l>

<l>The fires of wrath within him blazed.</l>
<l>Then like a mighty cloud on high,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In suppliant tone the Vánar prayed,</l>

<l>That shout, which shook the land with fear,</l>

<l>The sovereign with his dame reposed.</l>

<head>Canto XVI. The Fall Of Báli.</head>

<lg>
<l>Thus Tárá with the starry eyes<note place="foot">Tárá means <q>star.</q> The poet
plays upon the name by comparing her beauty
to that of the Lord of stars, the Moon.</note></l>
<l>Her counsel gave with burning sighs.</l>
<l>But Báli, by her prayers unmoved,</l>
<l>Spurned her advice, and thus reproved:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">How may this insult, scathe, and scorn</q></l>
<l>By me, dear love, be tamely born?</l>
<l>My brother, yea my foe, comes nigh</l>
<l>And dares me forth with shout and cry.</l>
<l>Learn, trembler! that the valiant, they</l>
<l>Who yield no step in battle fray,</l>
<l>Will die a thousand deaths but ne'er</l>
<l>An unavenged dishonour bear.</l>
<l>Nor, O my love, be thou dismayed</l>
<l>Though Ráma lend Sugríva aid,</l>
<l>For one so pure and duteous, one</l>
<l>Who loves the right, all sin will shun,</l>
<l>Release me from thy soft embrace,</l>
<l>And with thy dames thy steps retrace:</l>
<l>Enough already, O mine own,</l>
<l>Of love and sweet devotion shown.</l>
<l>Drive all thy fear and doubt away;</l>
<l>I seek Sugríva in the fray</l>
<l>His boisterous rage and pride to still,</l>
<l>And tame the foe I would not kill.</l>
<l>My fury, armed with brandished trees,</l>
<l>Shall strike Sugríva to his knees:</l>
<pb n="343"/><anchor id="Pg343"/>
<l>Nor shall the humbled foe withstand</l>
<l>The blows of my avenging hand,</l>
<l>When, nerved by rage and pride, I beat</l>
<l>The traitor down beneath my feet.</l>
<l>Thou, love, hast lent thine own sweet aid,</l>
<l>And all thy tender care displayed;</l>
<l>Now by my life, by these who yearn</l>
<l>To serve thee well, I pray thee turn.</l>
<l>But for a while, dear dame, I go</l>
<l><q rend="post">To come triumphant o'er the foe.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Báli spake in gentlest tone:</l>
<l>Soft arms about his neck were thrown;</l>
<l>Then round her lord the lady went</l>
<l>With sad steps slow and reverent.</l>
<l>She stood in solemn guise to bless</l>
<l>With prayers for safety and success,</l>
<l>Then with her train her chamber sought</l>
<l>By grief and racking fear distraught.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With serpent's pantings fierce and fast</l>
<l>King Báli from the city passed.</l>
<l>His glance, as each quick breath he drew,</l>
<l>Around to find the foe he threw,</l>
<l>And saw where fierce Sugríva showed</l>
<l>His form with golden hues that glowed,</l>
<l>And, as a fire resplendent, stayed</l>
<l>To meet his foe in arms arrayed.</l>
<l>When Báli, long-armed chieftain, found</l>
<l>Sugríva stationed on the ground,</l>
<l>Impelled by warlike rage he braced</l>
<l>His warrior garb about his waist,</l>
<l>And with his mighty arm raised high</l>
<l>Rushed at Sugríva with a cry.</l>
<l>But when Sugríva, fierce and bold,</l>
<l>Saw Báli with his chain of gold,</l>
<l>His arm he heaved, his hand he closed,</l>
<l>And face to face his foe opposed.</l>
<l>To him whose eyes with fury shone,</l>
<l>In charge impetuous rushing on,</l>
<l>Skilled in each warlike art and plan,</l>
<l>Báli with hasty words began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My ponderous hand, to fight addressed</q></l>
<l>With fingers clenched and arm compressed</l>
<l>Shall on thy death doomed brow descend</l>
<l><q rend="post">And, crashing down, thy life shall end.</q></l>
<l>He spoke; and wild with rage and pride,</l>
<l>The fierce Sugríva thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Thus let my arm begin the strife</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">And from thy body crush the life.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Báli, wounded and enraged,</l>
<l>With furious blows the battle waged.</l>
<l>Sugríva seemed, with blood-streams dyed,</l>
<l>A hill with fountains in his side.</l>
<l>But with his native force unspent</l>
<l>A Sál tree from the earth he rent,</l>
<l>And like the bolt of Indra smote</l>
<l>On Báli's head and chest and throat.</l>
<l>Bruised by the blows he could not shield,</l>
<l>Half vanquished Báli sank and reeled,</l>
<l>As sinks a vessel with her freight</l>
<l>Borne down by overwhelming weight.</l>
<l>Swift as Suparṇa's<note place="foot">Suparṇa, the Well-winged, is another
name of Garuḍa the King of Birds. See <ref target="Pg028">p. 28</ref>, Note.</note>
swiftest flight</l>
<l>In awful strength they rushed to fight:</l>
<l>So might the sun and moon on high</l>
<l>Encountering battle in the sky.</l>
<l>Fierce and more fierce, as fought the foes,</l>
<l>The furious rage of combat rose.</l>
<l>They warred with feet and arms and knees,</l>
<l>With nails and stones and boughs and trees,</l>
<l>And blows descending fast as rain</l>
<l>Dyed each dark form with crimson stain,</l>
<l>While like two thunder-clouds they met</l>
<l>With battle-cry and shout and threat.</l>
<l>Then Ráma saw Sugríva quail,</l>
<l>Marked his worn strength grow weak and fail.</l>
<l>Saw how he turned his wistful eye</l>
<l>To every quarter of the sky.</l>
<l>His friend's defeat he could not brook,</l>
<l>Bent on his shaft an eager look,</l>
<l>Then burned to slay the conquering foe,</l>
<l>And laid his arrow on the bow.</l>
<l>As to an orb the bow he drew</l>
<l>Forth from the string the arrow flew</l>
<l>Like Fate's tremendous discus hurled</l>
<l>By Yáma<note place="foot">The God of Death.</note> forth to end the world.</l>
<l>So loud the din that every bird</l>
<l>The bow-string's clans with terror heard,</l>
<l>And wildly fled the affrighted deer</l>
<l>As though the day of doom were near.</l>
<l>So, deadly as the serpent's fang,</l>
<l>Forth from the string the arrow sprang.</l>
<l>Like the red lightning's flash and flame</l>
<l>It flew unerring to its aim,</l>
<l>And, hissing murder through the air,</l>
<l>Pierced Báli's breast, and quivered there.</l>
<l>Struck by the shaft that flew so well</l>
<l>The mighty Vánar reeled and fell,</l>
<l>As earthward Indra's flag they pull</l>
<l>When Aśvíní's fair moon is full.<note place="foot">The flag-staff erected

<lg>
<l>Like some proud tree before the blast</l>
<l>Brave Báli to the ground was cast,</l>
<l>Where prostrate in the dust he rolled</l>
<l>Clad in the sheen of glistening gold,</l>
<pb n="344"/><anchor id="Pg344"/>
<l>As when uptorn the standard lies</l>
<l>Of the great God who rules the skies.</l>
<l>When low upon the earth was laid</l>
<l>The lord whom Vánar tribes obeyed,</l>
<l>Dark as a moonless sky no more</l>
<l>His land her joyous aspect wore.</l>
<l>Though low in dust and mire was rolled</l>
<l>The form of Báli lofty-souled,</l>
<l>Still life and valour, might and grace</l>
<l>Clung to their well-loved dwelling-place.</l>
<l>That golden chain with rich gems set,</l>
<l>The choicest gift of Sákra,<note place="foot">Indra the father of Báli.</note> yet</l>
<l>Preserved his life nor let decay</l>
<l>Steal strength and beauty's light away.</l>
<l>Still from that chain divinely wrought</l>
<l>His dusky form a glory caught,</l>
<l>As a dark cloud, when day is done,</l>
<l>Made splendid by the dying sun.</l>
<l>As fell the hero, crushed in fight,</l>
<l>There beamed afar a triple light</l>
<l>From limbs, from chain, from shaft that drank</l>
<l>His life-blood as the warrior sank.</l>
<l>The never-failing shaft, impelled</l>
<l>By the great bow which Ráma held,</l>
<l>Brought bliss supreme, and lit the way</l>
<l>To Brahmá's worlds which ne'er decay.<note place="foot"><p>It is believed that

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wounded Báli, when he saw</l>
<l>Ráma and Lakshmaṇ nearer draw,</l>
<l>Keen words to Raghu's son, impressed</l>
<l>With justice' holy stamp, addressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">What fame, from one thou hast not slain</q></l>
<l>In front of battle, canst thou gain,</l>
<l>Whose secret hand has laid me low</l>
<l>When madly fighting with my foe?</l>
<l>From every tongue thy glory rings,</l>
<l>A scion of a line of kings,</l>
<l>True to thy vows, of noblest race,</l>
<l>With every gentle gift and grace:</l>
<l>Whose tender heart for woe can feel,</l>
<l>And joy in every creature's weal:</l>
<l>Whose breast with high ambition swells,</l>
<l>Knows duty's claim and ne'er rebels.</l>
<l>They praise thy valour, patience, ruth,</l>
<l>Thy firmness, self-restraint, and truth:</l>
<l>Thy hand prepared for sin's control,</l>
<l>All virtues of a princely soul.</l>
<l>I thought of all these gifts of thine,</l>
<l>And glories of an ancient line,</l>
<l>I set my Tárá's tears at naught,</l>
<l>I met Sugríva and we fought.</l>
<l>O Ráma, till this fatal morn</l>
<l>I held that thou wouldst surely scorn</l>
<l>To strike me as I fought my foe</l>
<l>And thought not of a stranger's blow,</l>
<l>But now thine evil heart is shown,</l>
<l>A yawning well with grass o'ergrown.</l>
<l>Thou wearest virtue's badge,<note place="foot">The ascetic's dress which he wore
during his exile.</note> but guile</l>
<l>And meanest sin thy soul defile.</l>
<l>I took thee not for treacherous fire,</l>
<l>A sinner clad in saint's attire;</l>
<l>Nor deemed thou idly wouldst profess</l>
<l>The show and garb of righteousness.</l>
<l>In fenced town, in open land,</l>
<l>Ne'er hast thou suffered at this hand,</l>
<l>Nor canst of proud contempt complain:</l>
<l>Then wherefore is the guiltless slain?</l>
<l>My harmless life in woods I lead,</l>
<l>On forest fruits and roots I feed.</l>
<l>My foeman in the field I sought,</l>
<l>And ne'er with thee, O Ráma, fought.</l>
<l>Upon thy limbs, O King, I see</l>
<l>The raiment of a devotee;</l>
<l>And how can one like thee, who springs</l>
<l>From a proud line of ancient kings,</l>
<l>Beneath fair virtue's mask, disgrace</l>
<l>His lineage by a deed so base?</l>
<l>From Raghu is thy long descent,</l>
<l>For duteous deeds prëeminent:</l>
<l>Why, sinner clad in saintly dress,</l>
<l>Roamest thou through the wilderness?</l>
<l>Truth, valour, justice free from spot,</l>
<l>The hand that gives and grudges not,</l>
<l>The might that strikes the sinner down,</l>
<l>These bring a prince his best renown.</l>
<l>Here in the woods, O King, we live</l>
<l>On roots and fruit which branches give.<note place="foot">There is much
inconsistency in the passages of the poem in which the Vánars
are spoken of, which seems to point to two widely different legends. The Vánars are
generally represented as semi-divine beings with preternatural powers, living in houses
and eating and drinking like men sometimes as here, as monkeys pure and simple,
living is woods and eating fruit and roots.</note></l>

<l>Thus nature framed our harmless race:</l>

<l>'Tis not for mighty kings to tread</l>
<l>The flowery path, by pleasure led.</l>
<l>Theirs be the arm that crushes sin,</l>
<l>Theirs the soft grace to woo and win:</l>
<l>The steadfast will that guides the state,</l>
<l>Wise favour to the good and great;</l>
<l>And for all time are kings renowned</l>
<l>Who blend these arts and ne'er confound.</l>
<l>But thou art weak and swift to ire,</l>
<l>Unstable, slave of each desire.</l>
<l>Thou tramplest duty in the dust,</l>
<l>And in thy bow is all thy trust.</l>
<l>Thou carest naught for noble gain,</l>
<l>And treatest virtue with disdain,</l>
<l>While every sense its captive draws</l>
<l>To follow pleasure's changing laws.</l>
<l>I wronged thee not in word or deed,</l>
<l>But by thy deadly dart I bleed.</l>
<l>What wilt thou, mid the virtuous, say</l>
<l>To purge thy lasting stain away?</l>
<l>All these, O King, must sink to hell,</l>
<l>The regicide, the infidel,</l>

<head>Canto XVIII. Ráma's Reply.</head>

<lg>
<l>He ceased: and Ráma's heart was stirred</l>
<l>At every keen reproach he heard.</l>
<l>There Báli lay, a dim dark sun,</l>
<l>His course of light and glory run:</l>
<l>Or like the bed of Ocean dried</l>
<l>Of his broad floods from side to side,</l>
<l>Or helpless, as the dying fire,</l>
<l>Hushed his last words of righteous ire.</l>
<l>Then Ráma, with his spirit moved,</l>
<l>The Vánar king in turn reproved:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Why dost thou, Báli, thus revile,</q></l>
<l>And castest not a glance the while</l>
<l>On claims of duty, love, and gain,</l>
<l>And customs o'er the world that reign?</l>
<l>Why dost thou blame me, rash and blind,</l>
<l>Fickle as all thy Vánar kind,</l>
<l>Slighting each rule of ancient days</l>
<l>Which all the good and prudent praise?</l>
<l>This land, each hill and woody chase,</l>
<l>Belongs to old Ikshváku's race:</l>
<l>With bird and beast and man, the whole</l>
<l>Is ours to cherish and control.</l>
<l>Now Bharat, prompt at duty's call,</l>
<l>Wise, just, and true, is lord of all.</l>
<l>Each claim of law, love, gain he knows,</l>
<l>And wrath and favour duly shows.</l>
<l>A king from truth who never bends,</l>
<l>And grace with vigour wisely blends;</l>
<l>With valour worthy of his race,</l>
<l>He knows the claims of time and place.</l>
<l>Now we and other kings of might,</l>
<l>By his ensample taught aright,</l>
<l>The lands of every region tread</l>
<l>That justice may increase and spread.</l>
<l>While royal Bharat, wise and just,</l>
<l>Rules the broad earth, his glorious trust,</l>
<l>Who shall attempt, while he is lord,</l>
<l>A deed by Justice held abhorred?</l>
<l>We now, as Bharat has decreed,</l>
<l>Let justice guide our every deed,</l>
<l>And toil each sinner to repress</l>
<l>Who scorns the way of righteousness.</l>
<l>Thou from that path hast turned aside,</l>
<l>And virtue's holy law defied,</l>
<l>Left the fair path which kings should tread,</l>
<l>And followed pleasure's voice instead.</l>
<l>The man who cleaves to duty's law</l>
<l>Regards these three with filial awe—</l>
<l>The sire, the elder brother, third</l>
<l>Him from whose lips his lore he heard.</l>
<l>Thus too, for duty's sake, the wise</l>
<l>Regard with fond paternal eyes</l>
<l>The well-loved younger brother, one</l>
<l>Their lore has ripened, and a son.</l>
<l>Fine are the laws which guide the good,</l>
<l>Abstruse, and hardly understood;</l>
<l>Only the soul, enthroned within</l>
<l>The breast of each, knows right from sin.</l>
<l>But thou art wild and weak of soul,</l>
<l>And spurnest, like thy race, control;</l>
<l>The true and right thou canst not find,</l>
<l>The blind consulting with the blind.</l>
<l>Incline thine ear and I will teach</l>
<l>The cause that prompts my present speech.</l>
<l>This tempest of thy soul assuage,</l>
<l>Nor blame me in thine idle rage.</l>
<l>On this great sin thy thoughts bestow,</l>
<l>The sin for which I lay thee low.</l>
<l>Thou, Báli, in thy brother's life</l>
<l>Hast robbed him of his wedded wife,</l>
<l>And keepest, scorning ancient right,</l>
<l>His Rumá for thine own delight.</l>
<l>Thy son's own wife should scarcely be</l>
<l>More sacred in thine eyes than she.</l>
<l>All duty thou hast scorned, and hence</l>
<l>Comes punishment for dire offence.</l>
<l>For those who blindly do amiss</l>
<l>There is, I ween, no way but this:</l>
<l>To check the rash who dare to stray</l>
<l>From customs which the good obey,</l>
<l>I may not, sprung of Kshatriya line,</l>
<pb n="347"/><anchor id="Pg347"/>
<l>Forgive this heinous sin of thine:</l>
<l>The laws for those who sin like thee</l>
<l>The penalty of death decree.</l>
<l>Now Bharat rules with sovereign sway,</l>
<l>And we his royal word obey.</l>
<l>There was no hope of pardon, none,</l>
<l>For the vile deed that thou hast done,</l>
<l>That wisest monarch dooms to die</l>
<l>The wretch whose crimes the law defy;</l>
<l>And we, chastising those who err,</l>
<l>His righteous doom administer.</l>
<l>My soul accounts Sugríva dear</l>
<l>E'en as my brother Lakshmaṇ here.</l>
<l>He brings me blessing, and I swore</l>
<l>His wife and kingdom to restore:</l>
<l>A bond in solemn honour bound</l>
<l>When Vánar chieftains stood around.</l>
<l>And can a king like me forsake</l>
<l>His friend, and plighted promise break?</l>
<l>Reflect, O Vánar, on the cause,</l>
<l>The sanction of eternal laws,</l>
<l>And, justly smitten down, confess</l>
<l>Thou diest for thy wickedness.</l>
<l>By honour was I bound to lend</l>
<l>Assistance to a faithful friend;</l>
<l>And thou hast met a righteous fate</l>
<l>Thy former sins to expiate.</l>
<l>And thus wilt thou some merit win</l>
<l>And make atonement for thy sin.</l>
<l>For hear me, Vánar King, rehearse</l>
<l>What Manu<note place="foot">Manu, Book VIII. 318. <q>But men who
have committed offences and have received from kings the punishment due to them,
go pure to heaven and become as clear as those who have done well.</q></note>
spake in ancient verse,—</l>
<l>This holy law, which all accept</l>
<l>Who honour duty, have I kept:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Pure grow the sinners kings chastise,</q></l>
<l>And, like the virtuous, gain the skies;</l>
<l>By pain or full atonement freed,</l>
<l>They reap the fruit of righteous deed,</l>
<l>While kings who punish not incur</l>
<l><q rend="post">The penalties of those who err.</q></l>
<l>Mándhátá<note place="foot">Mándhátá was one of the earlier descendants
of Ikshváku. His name is mentioned
in Ráma's genealogy, <ref target="Pg081">p. 81</ref>.</note> once, a noble king,</l>
<l>Light of the line from which I spring,</l>
<l>Punished with death a devotee</l>
<l>When he had stooped to sin like thee;</l>
<l>And many a king in ancient time</l>
<l>Has punished frantic sinners' crime,</l>
<l>And, when their impious blood was spilt,</l>
<l>Has washed away the stain of guilt.</l>
<l>Cease, Báli, cease: no more complain:</l>
<l>Reproaches and laments are vain,</l>
<l>For thou art justly punished: we</l>
<l>Obey our king and are not free.</l>
<l>Once more, O Báli, lend thine ear</l>
<l>Another weightiest plea to hear.</l>
<l>For this, when heard and pondered well,</l>
<l>Will all complaint and rage dispel.</l>
<l>My soul will ne'er this deed repent,</l>
<l>Nor was my shaft in anger sent.</l>
<l>We take the silvan tribes beset</l>
<l>With snare and trap and gin and net,</l>
<l>And many a heedless deer we smite</l>
<l>From thickest shade, concealed from sight.</l>
<l>Wild for the slaughter of the game,</l>
<l>At stately stags our shafts we aim.</l>
<l>We strike them bounding scared away,</l>
<l>We strike them as they stand at bay,</l>
<l>When careless in the shade they lie,</l>
<l>Or scan the plain with watchful eye.</l>
<l>They turn away their heads; we aim,</l>
<l>And none the eager hunter blame.</l>
<l>Each royal saint, well trained in law</l>
<l>Of duty, loves his bow to draw</l>
<l>And strike the quarry, e'en as thou</l>
<l>Hast fallen by mine arrow now,</l>
<l>Fighting with him or unaware,—</l>
<l>A Vánar thou.—I little care.<note place="foot">I cannot understand how Válmíki
could put such an excuse as this into Ráma's mouth. Ráma with all solemn ceremony,
has made a league of alliance with Báli's younger brother whom he regards as a dear

coolly saying: <q>Besides you are only a monkey, you know, after all, and as such
I have every right to kill you how, when, and where I like.</q></note></l>
<l>But yet, O best of Vánars, know</l>
<l>That kings who rule the earth bestow</l>
<l>Fruit of pure life and virtuous deed,</l>
<l>And lofty duty's hard-won meed.</l>
<l>Harm not thy lord the king: abstain</l>

<head>Canto XIX. Tárá's Grief.</head>

<lg>
<l>No answer gave the Vánar king</l>
<l>To Ráma's prudent counselling.</l>
<l>Battered and bruised by tree and stone,</l>
<l>By Ráma's arrow overthrown,</l>
<l>Fainting upon the ground he lay,</l>
<l>Gasping his troubled life away.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Tárá in the Vánar's hall</l>
<l>Heard tidings of her husband's fall;</l>
<l>Heard that a shaft from Ráma's bow</l>
<l>Had laid the royal Báli low.</l>
<l>Her darling Angad by her side,</l>
<l>Distracted from her home she hied.</l>
<l>Then nigh the place of battle drew</l>
<l>The Vánars, Angad's retinue.</l>
<l>They saw the bow-armed Ráma: dread</l>
<l>Fell on them, and they turned and fled.</l>
<l>Like helpless deer, their leaders slain,</l>
<l>So wildly fled the startled train.</l>
<l>But Tárá saw, and nearer pressed,</l>
<l>And thus the flying band addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Vánars, ye who ever stand</q></l>
<l>About our king, a trusty band,</l>
<l>Where is the lion master? why</l>
<l>Forsake ye thus your lord and fly?</l>
<l>Say, lies he dead upon the plain,</l>
<l>A brother by a brother slain,</l>
<l>Or pierced by shafts from Ráma's bow</l>
<l><q rend="post">That rain from far upon the foe?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Tárá questioned, and was still:</l>
<l>Then, wearers of each shape at will,</l>
<l>The Vánars thus with one accord</l>
<l>Answered the Lady of their lord:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Turn, Tárá turn, and half undone</q></l>
<l>Save Angad thy beloved son.</l>
<l>There Ráma stands in death's disguise,</l>
<l>And conquered Báli faints and dies.</l>
<l>He by whose strong arm, thick and fast,</l>
<l>Uprooted trees and rocks were cast,</l>
<l>Lies smitten by a shaft that came</l>
<l>Resistless as the lightning flame.</l>
<l>When he, whose splendour once could vie</l>
<l>With Indra's, regent of the sky,</l>
<l>Fell by that deadly arrow, all</l>
<l>The Vánars fled who marked his fall.</l>
<l>Let all our chiefs their succours bring,</l>
<l>And Angad be anointed king;</l>
<pb n="349"/><anchor id="Pg349"/>
<l>For all who come of Vánar race</l>
<l>Will serve him set in Báli's place.</l>
<l>Or else our conquering foes to-day</l>
<l>Within our wall will force their way,</l>
<l>Polluting with their hostile feet</l>
<l>The chambers of thy loved retreat.</l>
<l>Great fear is on us, all and one.</l>

<l>They lust for power, are fierce and bold,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She heard their speech as, sore afraid,</l>
<l>Arrested in their flight, they stayed,</l>
<l>And gave her answer as became</l>
<l>The spirit of so true a dame:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Nay, what have I to do with pelf,</q></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">She hastened forth, her bosom rent</l>

<l>And striking, mastered by her woes,</l>
<l>Her head and breast with frantic blows.</l>
<l>She hurried to the field and found</l>
<l>Her husband prostrate on the ground,</l>
<l>Who quelled the hostile Vánars' might,</l>
<l>Whose bank was never turned in flight:</l>
<l>Whose arm a massy rock could throw</l>
<l>As Indra hurls his bolts below:</l>
<l>Fierce as the rushing tempest, loud</l>
<l>As thunder from a labouring cloud:</l>
<l>Whene'er he roared his voice of fear</l>
<l>Struck terror on the boldest ear:</l>
<l>Now slain, as, hungry for the prey,</l>
<l>A tiger might a lion slay:</l>
<l>Or when, his serpent foe to seek,</l>
<l>Suparṇa<note place="foot">A name of Garuḍa the king of birds,

<l>Tears up a sacred hillock, long</l>
<l>The reverence of a village throng,</l>
<l>Its altar with their offerings spread,</l>
<l>And the gay flag that waved o'erhead.</l>
<l>She looked and saw the victor stand</l>
<l>Resting upon his bow his hand:</l>
<l>And fierce Sugríva she descried,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ by his brother's side.</l>
<l>She passed them by, nor stayed to view,</l>
<l>Swift to her husband's side she flew;</l>
<l>Then as she looked, her strength gave way,</l>
<l>And in the dust she fell and lay.</l>
<l>Then, as if startled ere the close</l>
<l>Of slumber, from the earth she rose.</l>
<l>Upon her dying husband, round</l>
<l>Whose soul the coils of Death were wound,</l>
<l>Her eyes in agony she bent</l>
<l>And called him with a shrill lament.</l>
<l>Sugríva, when he heard her cries,</l>

<lg>
<l>Again she bent her to the ground,</l>

<l>Fate ne'er agreed our lives to bless</l>
<l>With simultaneous happiness:</l>
<l>To dwell like brothers side by side</l>
<l>In tender love was still denied.</l>
<l>The Vánars' realm is thine to-day:</l>
<l>Begin, O King, thy rightful sway;<note place="foot">Angad himself, being too young to
govern, would be Yuvarája or heir-apparent.</note></l>
<l>For I must go at Yáma's call</l>

<l>Must part and leave this very hour</l>
<l>My life, my realm, my kingly power,</l>
<l>And go instead of these to gain</l>
<l>Bright glory free from spot and stain.</l>
<l>Now at thy hands one boon I seek</l>
<l>With the last words my lips shall speak,</l>
<l>And, though it be no easy thing,</l>
<l>Perform the task I give thee, King.</l>
<l>This son of mine, no foolish boy,</l>
<l>Worthy of bliss and nursed in joy,—</l>
<l>See, prostrate on the ground he lies,</l>
<l>The hot tears welling from his eyes—</l>
<l>The child I love so well, more sweet</l>
<l>Than life itself, for woe unmeet,—</l>

<l>Where stricken fiends shall own his might.</l>
<l>While yet a tender stripling, fame</l>
<l>Shall bruit abroad his warrior name,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The loving speech Sugríva heard,</l>

<l>On little Angad standing nigh</l>

<lg>
<l>But when Sugríva saw her weep</l>
<l>O'erwhelmed in sorrow's rushing deep,</l>
<l>Swift through his bosom pierced the sting</l>
<l>Of anguish for the fallen king.</l>
<l>At the sad sight his eyes beheld</l>
<l>A flood of bitter tears outwelled,</l>
<l>And, with his bosom racked and rent,</l>
<l>To Ráma with his train he went.</l>
<l>He came with faltering steps and slow</l>
<l>Where Ráma held his mighty bow</l>
<l>And arrow like a venomed snake,</l>
<l>And to the son of Raghu spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Well hast thou kept, O King, thy vow:</q></l>
<l>The promised fruit is gathered now.</l>
<l>But life is marred, my soul to-day</l>
<l>Turns sickening from all joy away.</l>
<l>For, while this queen laments and sighs</l>
<l>Amid a mourning people's cries,</l>
<l>And Angad weeps his father slain,</l>
<l>How can my heart delight to reign?</l>
<l>For outrage, fury, senseless pride,</l>
<l>My brother, doomed of yore, has died.</l>
<l>Yet, Raghu's son, in bitter woe</l>
<l>I mourn his fated overthrow.</l>
<l>Ah, better far in pain and ill</l>
<l>To dwell on Rishyamúka still</l>
<l>Than gain the heaven of Gods and all</l>
<l>Its pleasures by my brother's fall.</l>
<l>Did not he cry,—great-hearted foe,—</l>
<l><q>Go, for I will not slay thee, Go</q>?</l>
<l>With his brave soul those words agree:</l>
<l>My speech, my deeds, are worthy me.</l>
<l>How can a brother counterweigh</l>
<l>His grievous loss with joys of sway,</l>
<l>And see with dull unpitying eye</l>
<l>So brave and good a brother die?</l>
<l>His lofty soul was nobly blind:</l>
<l>My death alas, he ne'er designed;</l>
<l>But I, urged blindly on by hate,</l>
<l>Sought with his life my rage to sate.</l>
<l>He smote me with a splintered tree:</l>
<l>I groaned aloud and turned to flee,</l>
<l>From stern reproaches he forbore,</l>
<l>And gently bade me sin no more.</l>
<l>Serene and dutiful and good</l>
<l>He kept the laws of brotherhood:</l>
<l>I, fierce and greedy, vengeful, base,</l>
<l>Showed all the vices of our race.</l>
<l>Ah me, dear friend, my brother's fate</l>
<l>Lays on my soul a crushing weight:</l>
<l>A sin no heart should e'er conceive,</l>
<l>But at the thought each soul should grieve:</l>
<l>Sin such as Indra's when his blow</l>

<l>Yet earth, the waters of the seas,</l>
<l>The race of women and the trees</l>
<l>Were fain upon themselves to take</l>
<l>The weight of sin for Indra's sake.</l>
<l>But who a Vánar's soul will free,</l>
<l>Or ease the load that crushes me?</l>
<l>Wretch that I am, I may not claim</l>
<l>The reverence due to royal name.</l>
<l>How shall I reign supreme, or dare</l>
<l>Affect the power I should not share?</l>
<l>Ah me, I sorrow for my sin,</l>
<l>The ruin of my race and kin,</l>
<l>Polluted by a hideous crime</l>
<l>World-hated till the end of time.</l>

<l>No flash of lightning lit the sky,</l>
<l>No cloudlet marred the blue on high.</l>
<l>The Saras<note place="foot">The Indian crane; a magnificent bird

<l>The moon's full beams were bright again.</l>
<l>Sugríva, lapped in bliss, forgot</l>
<l>The claims of faith, or heeded not;</l>
<l>And by alluring joys misled</l>
<l>The path of falsehood learned to tread.</l>
<l>In careless ease he passed each hour,</l>
<l>And dallied in his lady's bower.</l>
<l>Each longing of his heart was stilled,</l>
<l>And every lofty hope fulfilled.</l>
<l>With royal Rumá by his side,</l>
<l>Or Tárá yet a dearer bride,</l>
<pb n="360"/><anchor id="Pg360"/>
<l>He spent each joyous day and night</l>
<l>In revelry and wild delight,</l>
<l>Like Indra whom the nymphs entice</l>
<l>To taste the joys of Paradise.</l>
<l>The power to courtiers' hands resigned,</l>
<l>To all their acts his eyes were blind.</l>
<l>All doubt, all fear he cast aside</l>
<l>And lived with pleasure for his guide.</l>
<l>But sage Hanúmán, firm and true,</l>
<l>Whose heart the lore of Scripture knew,</l>
<l>Well trained to meet occasion, trained</l>
<l>In all by duty's law ordained,</l>
<l>Strove with his prudent speech to find</l>

<l>He, skilled in every gentle art</l>
<l>Of eloquence that wins the heart,</l>
<l>Sugríva from his trance to wake,</l>
<l>His salutary counsel spake:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">The realm is won, thy name advanced,</q></l>
<l>The glory of thy house enhanced,</l>
<l>And now thy foremost care should be</l>
<l>To aid the friends who succoured thee.</l>
<l>He who is firm and faithful found</l>
<l>To friendly ties in honour bound,</l>
<l>Will see his name and fame increase</l>
<l>And his blest kingdom thrive in peace.</l>
<l>Wide sway is his who truly boasts</l>

<l>Do thou, whose footsteps never stray</l>
<l>From the clear bounds of duty's way,</l>
<l>Assist, as honour bids thee, now</l>
<l>Thy friends, observant of thy vow.</l>
<l>For if all cares we lay not by,</l>

<l>Up! nor the promised help delay</l>

<l>Long joined to thee in friendly ties</l>
<l>He made thy fame and fortune rise,</l>

<l>To him who realm and life restored?</l>
<l>Exert thy power, and thou hast won</l>
<l>The love of Daśaratha's son:</l>
<l>And wilt thou for his summons wait,</l>
<l>And, till he call thee, hesitate?</l>
<l>Think not the hero needs thy power</l>
<l>To save him in the desperate hour:</l>
<l>He with his arrows could subdue</l>
<l>The Gods and all the demon crew,</l>
<l>And only waits that he may see</l>

<l>Then let us trace through earth and skies</l>
<l>His lady wheresoe'er she lies.</l>
<l>Through realms above, beneath, we flee,</l>

<l>Then why, O Lord of Vánars, still</l>
<l>Delay us waiting for thy will?</l>

<head>Canto XXX. Ráma's Lament.</head>

<lg>
<l>But Ráma in the autumn night</l>
<l>Stood musing on the mountain height,</l>
<l>While grief and love that scorned control</l>
<l>Shook with wild storms the hero's soul.</l>
<l>Clear was the sky, without a cloud</l>
<l>The glory of the moon to shroud.</l>
<l>And bright with purest silver shone</l>
<l>Each hill the soft beams looked upon.</l>
<l>He knew Sugríva's heart was bent</l>
<l>On pleasure, gay and negligent.</l>
<l>He thought on Janak's child forlorn</l>
<l>From his fond arms for ever torn.</l>
<l>He mourned occasion slipping by,</l>
<l>And faint with anguish heaved each sigh.</l>
<pb n="361"/><anchor id="Pg361"/>
<l>He sat where many a varied streak</l>
<l>Of rich ore marked the mountain peak.</l>
<l>He raised his eyes the sky to view,</l>
<l>And to his love his sad thoughts flew.</l>
<l>He heard the Sáras cry, and faint</l>
<l>With sorrow poured his love-born plaint:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">She, she who mocked the softest tone</q></l>
<l>Of wild birds' voices with her own,—</l>
<l>Where strays she now, my love who played</l>
<l>So happy in our hermit shade?</l>
<l>How can my absent love behold</l>
<l>The bright trees with their flowers of gold,</l>
<l>And all their gleaming glory see</l>
<l>With eyes that vainly look for me?</l>
<l>How is it with my darling when</l>
<l>From the deep tangles of the glen</l>
<l>Float carols of each bird elate</l>
<l>With rapture singing to his mate?</l>
<l>In vain my weary glances rove</l>
<l>From lake to hill, from stream to grove:</l>
<l>I find no rapture in the scene,</l>
<l>And languish for my fawn-eyed queen.</l>
<l>Ah, does strong love with wild unrest,</l>
<l>Born of the autumn, stir her breast?</l>
<l>And does the gentle lady pine</l>
<l><q rend="post">Till her bright eyes shall look in mine?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Raghu's son in piteous tone,</l>
<l>O'erwhelmed with sorrow, made his moan.</l>
<l>E'en as the bird that drinks the rains<note place="foot">The Chátaka, Cuculus,

<l>To Indra thousand-eyed complains.</l>
<l>Then Lakshmaṇ who had wandered through</l>
<l>The copses where the berries grew,</l>
<l>Returning to the cavern found</l>
<l>His brother chief in sorrow drowned,</l>
<l>And pitying the woes that broke</l>
<l>The spirit of the hero spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Why cast thy strength of soul away,</q></l>
<l>And weakly yield to passion's sway?</l>
<l>Arise, my brother, do and dare</l>

<l>Recall the firmness of thy heart,</l>
<l>And nerve thee for a hero's part.</l>

<l>The red flame quickened by the breeze?</l>
<l>Where is the foe will dare to wrong</l>
<l><q rend="post">Or keep the Maithil lady long?</q></l>

<l>The clouds with voices loud and deep,</l>
<l>Veiling each tree upon the steep,</l>
<l>Up on the thirsty earth have shed</l>
<l>Their precious burden and are fled.</l>
<l>Now in kings' hearts ambition glows:</l>
<l>They rush to battle with their foes;<note place="foot">The time for warlike
expeditions began when the rains had ceased.</note></l>
<l>But in Sugríva's sloth I see</l>
<l>No care for deeds of chivalry.</l>
<l>See, Lakshmaṇ, on each breezy height</l>
<l>A thousand autumn blooms are bright.</l>
<l>See how the wings of wild swans gleam</l>
<l>On every islet of the stream.</l>
<l>Four months of flood and rain are past:</l>
<l>A hundred years they seemed to last</l>
<l>To me whom toil and trouble tried,</l>
<l>My Sítá severed from my side.</l>
<l>She, gentlest woman, weak and young,</l>
<l>Still to her lord unwearied clung.</l>
<l>Still by the exile's side she stood</l>
<l>In the wild ways of Daṇḍak wood,</l>
<l>Like a fond bird disconsolate</l>
<l>If parted from her darling mate.</l>
<l>Sugríva, lapped in soft repose,</l>
<l>Untouched by pity for my woes,</l>
<l>Scorns the poor exile, dispossessed,</l>
<l>By Rávaṇ's mightier arm oppressed,</l>
<l>The wretch who comes to sue and pray</l>
<l>From his lost kingdom far away.</l>
<l>Hence falls on me the Vánar's scorn,</l>
<l>A suitor friendless and forlorn.</l>
<l>The time is come: with heedless eye</l>
<l>He sees the hour of action fly,—</l>
<l>Unmindful, now his hopes succeed,</l>
<l>Of promise made in stress of need.</l>
<l>Go seek him sunk in bliss and sloth,</l>
<l>Forgetful of his royal oath,</l>
<l>And as mine envoy thus upbraid</l>
<l>The monarch for his help delayed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Vile is the wretch who will not pay</q></l>
<l>The favour of an earlier day,</l>
<l>Hope in the supplicant's breast awakes,</l>

<l>Who keeps the words his lips have sworn,</l>
<l>Yea, if those words be good or ill,</l>

<l>The thankless who forget to aid</l>
<l>The friend who helped them when they prayed,</l>
<l>Dishonoured in their death shall lie,</l>
<l>And dogs shall pass their corpses by.</l>
<l>Sure thou wouldst see my strained arm hold</l>

<l>Wouldst gaze upon its awful form</l>

<head>Canto XXXI. The Envoy.</head>

<lg>
<l>Thus Ráma spoke, and Lakshmaṇ then</l>
<l>Made answer to the prince of men:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Yea, if the Vánar, undeterred</q></l>
<l>By fear of vengeance, break his word,</l>
<l>Loss of his royal power ere long</l>
<l>Shall pay the traitor for the wrong.</l>
<l>Nor deem I him so void of sense</l>
<l>To brave the bitter consequence.</l>
<l>But if enslaved to joy he lie,</l>
<l>And scorn thy grace with blinded eye,</l>
<l>Then let him join his brother slain:</l>
<l>Unmeet were such a wretch to reign.</l>
<l>Quick rises, kindling in my breast,</l>
<l>The wrath that will not be repressed,</l>
<l>And bids me in my fury slay</l>
<l>The breaker of his faith to-day.</l>
<l>Let Báli's son thy consort trace</l>
<l><q rend="post">With bravest chiefs of Vánar race.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the hero, and aglow</l>
<l>With rage of battle seized his bow.</l>
<l>But Ráma thus in gentler mood</l>
<l>With fitting words his speech renewed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">No hero with a soul like thine</q></l>
<l>To paths of sin will e'er incline,</l>
<l>He who his angry heart can tame</l>
<l>Is worthiest of a hero's name.</l>
<l>Not thine, my brother, be the part</l>
<l>So alien from the tender heart,</l>
<l>Nor let thy feet by wrath misled</l>
<l>Forsake the path they loved to tread.</l>
<l>From harsh and angry words abstain:</l>
<l>With gentle speech a hearing gain,</l>
<l>And tax Sugríva with the crime</l>
<l><q rend="post">Of failing faith and wasted time.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Lakshmaṇ, bravest of the brave,</l>
<l>Obeyed the hest that Ráma gave,</l>
<l>To whom devoting every thought</l>
<l>The Vánar's royal town he sought.</l>
<l>As Mandar's mountain heaves on high</l>
<l>His curved peak soaring to the sky,</l>
<l>So Lakshmaṇ showed, his dread bow bent</l>
<l>Like Indra's<note place="foot">The rainbow.</note> in the firmament.</l>
<l>His brother's wrath, his brother's woe</l>
<l>Inflamed his soul to fiercest glow.</l>
<l>The tallest trees to earth were cast</l>
<l>As furious on his way he passed,</l>
<l>And where he stepped, so fiercely fleet,</l>
<l>The stones were shivered by his feet.</l>
<l>He reached Kishkindhá's city deep</l>
<l>Embosomed where the hills were steep,</l>
<l>Where street and open square were lined</l>
<l>With legions of the Vánar kind.</l>
<l>Then, as his lips with fury swelled,</l>
<l>The lord of Raghu's line beheld</l>
<l>A stream of Vánar chiefs outpoured</l>
<l>To do obeisance to their lord.</l>
<l>But when the mighty prince in view</l>
<l>Of the thick coming Vánars drew,</l>
<l>They turned them in amaze to seize</l>
<l>Crags of the rock and giant trees.</l>
<l>He saw, and fiercer waxed his ire,</l>
<l>As oil lends fury to the fire.</l>
<l>Scarce had the Vánar chieftains seen</l>
<l>That wrathful eye, that troubled mien</l>
<l>Fierce as the God's who rules the dead,</l>
<l>When, turned in wild affright, they fled.</l>
<l>Speeding in breathless terror all</l>
<l>Sought King Sugríva's council hall,</l>
<l>And there made known their tale of fear,</l>
<l>That Lakshmaṇ wild with rage, was near.</l>
<l>The king, untroubled by alarms,</l>
<l>Held Tárá in his amorous arms,</l>
<l>And in the distant bower with her</l>
<l>Heard not each clamorous messenger.</l>
<l>Then, summoned at the lords' behest</l>
<l>Forth from the city portals pressed,</l>
<l>Each like some elephant or cloud,</l>
<l>The Vánars in a trembling crowd:</l>
<l>Fierce warriors all with massive jaws</l>
<l>And terrors of their tiger claws,</l>
<l>Some matched ten elephants, and some</l>
<l>A hundred's strength could overcome.</l>
<l>Some chieftains, mightier than the rest,</l>
<l>Ten times a hundred's force possessed.</l>
<l>With eyes of fury Lakshmaṇ viewed</l>
<l>The Vánars' tree-armed multitude.</l>
<l>Thus garrisoned from side to side</l>
<l>The city walls assault defied.</l>
<l>Beyond the moat that girt the wall</l>
<l>Advanced the Vánar chiefs; and all</l>
<l>Upon the plain in firm brigade,</l>
<l>Impetuous warriors, stood arrayed.</l>
<pb n="363"/><anchor id="Pg363"/>
<l>Red at the sight flashed Lakshmaṇ's eyes,</l>
<l>His bosom heaved tumultuous sighs,</l>
<l>And forth the fire of fury broke</l>
<l>Like flame that flashes through the smoke.</l>
<l>Like some fierce snake the hero stood:</l>
<l>His bow recalled the expanded hood,</l>
<l>And in his shaft-head bright and keen</l>
<l>The flickering of its tongue was seen:</l>
<l>And in his own all-conquering might</l>
<l>The venom of its deadly bite.</l>
<l>Prince Angad marked his angry look,</l>
<l>And every hope his heart forsook.</l>
<l>Then, his large eyes with fury red,</l>
<l>To Angad Lakshmaṇ turned and said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>

<l>And ask if he will aid his friend.</l>
<l>Go, let the king my message learn:</l>
<l><q rend="post">Then hither with all speed return.</q></l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prince Angad heard and wild with grief</l>

<l><q rend="pre">'Tis Lakshmaṇ's self: impelled by ire</q></l>

<l>At the fierce words and furious look</l>
<l>Of Raghu's son he quailed and shook.</l>
<l>Back through the city gates he sped,</l>
<l>And, laden with the tale of dread,</l>
<l>Sought King Sugríva, filled his ears</l>
<l>And Rumá's with his doubts and fears.</l>
<l>To Rumá and the king he bent,</l>
<l>And clasped their feet most reverent,</l>
<l>Clasped the dear feet of Tárá, too,</l>
<l>And told the startling tale anew.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But King Sugríva's ear was dulled,</l>
<l>By love and wine and languor lulled,</l>
<l>Nor did the words that Angad spake</l>
<l>The slumberer from his trance awake.</l>
<l>But soon as Raghu's son came nigh</l>
<l>The startled Vánars raised a cry,</l>
<l>And strove to win his grace, while dread</l>
<l>Each anxious heart disquieted.</l>
<l>They saw, and, as they gathered round,</l>
<l>Rose from the mighty throng a sound</l>
<l>Like torrents when they downward dash,</l>
<l>Or thunder with the lightning's flash.</l>
<l>The shouting of the Vánars broke</l>
<l>Sugríva's slumber, and he woke:</l>
<l>Still with the wine his eyes were red,</l>
<l>His neck with flowers was garlanded.</l>
<l>Roused at the voice of Angad came</l>
<l>Two Vánar lords of rank and fame;</l>
<l>One Yaksha, one Prabháva hight,—</l>

<l>Still fiery-eyed with rage and hate</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: and Hanumán of all</l>
<l>The Vánars in the council hall</l>
<l>In wisdom first, and rank, expressed</l>
<l>The thoughts that filled his prudent breast:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">No marvel thou rememberest yet</q></l>
<l>The service thou shouldst ne'er forget,</l>
<l>How the brave prince of Raghu's seed</l>
<l>Thy days from fear and peril freed;</l>

<l>Whom Indra's self might scarce subdue.</l>
<l>I doubt not Ráma's anger burns</l>
<l>For the scant love thy heart returns.</l>
<l>For this he sends his brother, him</l>
<l>Whose glory never waxes dim.</l>
<l>Sunk in repose thy careless eye</l>
<l>Marks not the seasons as they fly,</l>

<l>Clear is the sky: no cloudlet mars</l>

<l>High duty bids a courtier seek</l>

<l>So by no thought of fear controlled</l>
<l>My speech, O King, is free and bold,</l>

<l>Unwise to stir his wrathful mood</l>

<head>Canto XXXIII. Lakshman's Entry.</head>

<lg>
<l>Through the fair city Lakshmaṇ came,</l>
<l>Invited in Sugríva's name.</l>
<l>Within the gates the guardian bands,</l>
<l>Of Vánars raised their suppliant hands,</l>
<l>And in their ordered ranks, amazed,</l>
<l>Upon the princely hero gazed,</l>
<l>They marked each burning breath he drew,</l>
<l>The fury of his soul they knew.</l>
<l>Their hearts were chilled with sudden fear:</l>
<l>They gazed, but dared not venture near,</l>
<l>Before his eyes the city, gay</l>
<l>With gems and flowery gardens, lay,</l>
<l>Where fane and palace rose on high,</l>
<l>And things of beauty charmed the eye.</l>
<l>Where trees of every blossom grew</l>
<l>Yielding their fruit in season due</l>
<l>To Vánars of celestial seed</l>
<l>Who wore each varied form at need,</l>
<l>Fair-faced and glorious with the shine</l>
<l>Of heavenly robes and wreaths divine.</l>
<l>There sandal, aloe, lotus bloomed,</l>
<l>And there delicious breath perfumed</l>
<l>The city's broad street, redolent</l>
<l>Of sugary mead<note place="foot">Maireya, a spirituous liquor from the
blossoms of the Lythrum fruticosum, with
sugar, &amp;c.</note> and honey scent.</l>
<l>There many a lofty palace rose</l>
<l>Like Vindhya or the Lord of Snows,</l>
<l>And with sweet murmur sparkling rills</l>
<l>Leapt lightly down the sheltering hills.</l>
<l>On many a glorious palace, raised</l>
<l>For prince and noble,<note place="foot">Their names are as follows:
Angad, Maínda, Dwida, Gavaya, Gaváksha, Gaja, Śarabha, Vidyunmáli,
Sampáti, Súryáksa, Hanumán, Vírabáhu, Subáhu, Nala, Kúmuda, Susheṇa, Tára,
Jámbuvatu, Dadhivakra, Níla, Supátala, and Sunetra.</note> Lakshmaṇ gazed:</l>
<l>Like clouds of paly hue they shone</l>
<l>With fragrant wreaths that hung thereon:</l>
<l>There wealth of jewels was enshrined,</l>
<l>And fairer gems of womankind.</l>
<l>There gleamed, of noble height and size,</l>
<l>Like Indra's mansion in the skies,</l>
<l>Protected by a crystal fence</l>
<l>Of rock, the royal residence,</l>
<l>With roof and turret high and bright</l>
<l>Like Mount Kailása's loftiest height.</l>
<l>There blooming trees, Mahendra's gift,</l>
<l>High o'er the walls were seen to lift</l>
<l>Their golden fruited boughs, that made</l>
<l>With leaf and flower delicious shade.</l>
<l>He saw a band of Vánars wait,</l>
<pb n="365"/><anchor id="Pg365"/>
<l>Wielding their weapons, at the gate</l>
<l>Where golden portals flashed between</l>
<l>Celestial garlands red and green.</l>
<l>Within Sugríva's fair abode</l>
<l>Unchecked the mighty hero strode,</l>
<l>As when the sun of autumn shrouds</l>
<l>His glory in a pile of clouds.</l>
<l>Through seven wide courts he quickly passed,</l>
<l>And reached the royal tower at last,</l>
<l>Where seats were set with couch and bed</l>
<l>Of gold and silver richly spread.</l>
<l>While the young chieftain's feet drew near</l>
<l>The sound of music reached his ear,</l>
<l>As the soft breathings of the flute</l>
<l>Came blending with the voice and lute.</l>
<l>Then beauty showed her youth and grace</l>
<l>And varied charm of form and face:</l>
<l>Soft bright-eyed creatures, fair and young,—</l>
<l>Gay garlands round their necks were hung,</l>
<l>And greater charms to each were lent</l>
<l>By richest dress and ornament.</l>
<l>He saw the calm attendants wait</l>
<l>About their lord in careless state,</l>
<l>Heard women's girdles chime in sweet</l>
<l>Accordance with their tinkling feet.</l>
<l>He heard the anklet's silvery sound,</l>
<l>He saw the calm that reigned around,</l>
<l>And o'er him, as he listened, came</l>
<l>A rush of rage, a flood of shame.</l>
<l>He drew his bowstring: with the clang</l>
<l>From ease to west the welkin rang:</l>
<l>Then in his modest mood withdrew</l>
<l>A little from the ladies' view.</l>
<l>And sternly silent stood apart,</l>
<l>While wrath for Ráma filled his heart.</l>
<l>Sugríva knew the sounding string,</l>
<l>And at the call the Vánar king</l>
<l>Sprang swiftly from his golden seat,</l>
<l>And feared the coming prince to meet.</l>
<l>Then with cold lips that terror dried</l>
<l>To beauteous Tárá thus he cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What cause of anger, O my spouse</q></l>
<l>Fair with the charm of lovely brows,</l>
<l>Sets Lakshmaṇ's gentle breast on fire,</l>
<l>And brings him in unwonted ire?</l>
<l>Say, canst thou see, O faultless dame,</l>
<l>A cause to fill his soul with flame?</l>
<l>For there must be a reason when</l>
<l>Such fury stirs the king of men.</l>
<l>Reveal the sin, if sin of mine</l>
<l>Anger the lord of Raghu's line.</l>
<l>Or go thyself, his rage subdue,</l>
<l>And with soft words his favour woo.</l>
<l>Soon as on thee his eyes are set</l>
<l>His heart this anger will forget,</l>
<l>For men like him of lofty mind</l>
<l>Are never stern with womankind.</l>
<l>First let thy gentle speech disarm</l>
<l>His fury, and his spirit charm,</l>
<l>And I, from fear of peril free,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The conqueror of his foes will see.</q></l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She heard: with faltering steps and slow,</l>
<l>With eyes that shone with trembling glow,</l>
<l>With gold-girt body gently bent</l>
<l>To meet the stranger prince she went.</l>
<l>When Lakshmaṇ saw the Vánar queen</l>
<l>With tranquil eyes and modest mien,</l>
<l>Before the dame he bent his head,</l>
<l>And anger, at her presence, fled.</l>
<l>Made bold by draughts of wine, and cheered</l>
<l>By Lakshmaṇ's look no more she feared,</l>
<l>And in the trust his favour lent</l>
<l>She thus addressed him eloquent:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Whence springs thy burning fury? say:</q></l>
<l>Who dares thy will to disobey?</l>
<l>Who checks the maddened flames that seize</l>
<l><q rend="post">On forests full of withered trees?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Lakshmaṇ spoke, her mind to ease,</l>
<l>His kind reply in words like these:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Thy lord his days in pleasure spends,</q></l>
<l>Heedless of duty and of friends,</l>
<l>Nor dost thou mark, though fondly true,</l>
<l>The evil path his steps pursue.</l>
<l>He cares not for affairs of state,</l>
<l>Nor us forlorn and desolate,</l>
<l>But sits a mere spectator still,</l>
<l>A sensual slave to pleasure's will.</l>
<l>Four months were fixed, the time agreed</l>
<l>When he should help us in our need:</l>
<l>But, bound in toils of pleasure fast,</l>
<l>He sees not that the months are past.</l>
<l>Where beats the heart which draughts of wine</l>
<l>To virtue or to gain incline?</l>
<l>Hast thou not heard those draughts destroy</l>
<l>Virtue and gain and love and joy?</l>
<l>For those who, helped at need, refuse</l>
<l>Their aid in turn, their virtue lose:</l>
<l>And they who scorn a friend disdain</l>
<l>A treasure naught may buy again.</l>
<l>Thy lord has cast his friend away,</l>
<l>Nor feared from virtue's path to stray,</l>
<l>If this be true, declare, O dame</l>
<l>Who knowest duty's every claim,</l>
<l>What further work remains for us</l>
<l><q rend="post">Deceived and disappointed thus.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She listened, for his words were kind,</l>
<l>Where virtue showed with gain combined,</l>

<l>With those who live and honour thee:</l>
<l>And thou shouldst bear without offence</l>
<l>Thy servant's fitful negligence.</l>
<l>I know the seasons glide away,</l>
<l>While Ráma maddens at delay</l>
<l>I know what deed our thanks has earned,</l>
<l>I know that grace should be returned.</l>
<l>But still I know, whate'er befall,</l>
<l>That conquering love is lord of all;</l>
<pb n="366"/><anchor id="Pg366"/>
<l>Know where Sugríva's thoughts, possessed</l>
<l>By one absorbing passion, rest.</l>
<l>But he whom sensual joys debase</l>
<l>Heeds not the claim of time and place,</l>
<l>And sees not with his blinded sight</l>
<l>His duty or his gain aright.</l>
<l>O pardon him who loves me! spare</l>
<l>The Vánar caught in pleasure's snare,</l>
<l>And once again let Ráma grace</l>
<l>With favour him who rules our race.</l>
<l>E'en royal saints, whose chief delight</l>
<l>Was penance and austerest rite,</l>
<l>At love's commandment have unbent,</l>
<l>Beguiled by sweetest blandishment.</l>
<l>And know, Sugríva, roused at last,</l>
<l>The order to his lords has passed,</l>
<l>And, long by love and bliss delayed,</l>
<l>Wakes all on fire your hopes to aid.</l>
<l>A countless host his city fills,</l>
<l>New-gathered from a thousand hills:</l>
<l>Impetuous chiefs, who wear at need</l>
<l>Each varied form, his legions lead.</l>
<l>Come then, O hero, kept aloof</l>
<l>By modest awe, nor fear reproof:</l>

<l>Sugríva started from his rest</l>
<l>With doubt and terror in his breast.</l>
<l>He heard the prince's furious tread</l>
<l>He saw his eyes glow fiercely red.</l>
<l>Swift sprang the monarch to his feet</l>
<l>Upstarting from his golden seat.</l>
<l>Rose Rumá and her fellows, too,</l>

<l>Sugríva glanced with reddened eyes,</l>

<l>Whose soul is touched with tender ruth,</l>
<l>Who, liberal, keeps each sense subdued,</l>

<l>But all unmeet a king to be,</l>
<l>The meanest of the mean is he</l>
<l>Who basely breaks the promise made</l>
<l>To trusting friends who lent him aid.</l>
<l>He sins who for a steed has lied,</l>
<l>As if a hundred steeds had died:</l>
<l>Or if he lie, a cow to win,</l>
<l>Tenfold as heavy is the sin.</l>
<l>But if the lie a man betray,</l>
<l>Both he and his shall all decay.<note place="foot">The meaning is that if a man

<l>O Vánar King, the thankless man</l>
<l>Is worthy of the general ban,</l>
<l>Who takes assistance of his friends,</l>
<l>And in his turn no service lends.</l>
<l>This verse of old by Brahmá sung</l>

<l>Hear what He cried in angry mood</l>
<l>Bewailing man's ingratitude:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">For draughts of wine, for slaughtered cows,</q></l>
<l>For treacherous theft, for broken vows</l>

<l>Ungrateful, Vánar King, art thou,</l>

<l>Thou shunnest to repay the debt:</l>
<l>Or, grateful, thou hadst surely pressed</l>
<l>To aid the hero in his quest.</l>
<l>Thou art, in vulgar pleasures drowned,</l>

as one of the loftiest peaks of the Himálayas, to Mahendra in the extreme south,
from the mountain in the east where the sun is said to rise to Astáchal or the western

<l>Thus all the princely Vánars, true</l>
<l>To their appointed tasks, withdrew.</l>
<l>Sugríva deemed already done</l>
<l>The work he planned for Raghu's son.</l>

<l><q rend="post">'Tis mine thy mandate to obey.</q></l>
<l>Sugríva bade the dames adieu,</l>
<l>And Tárá and the rest withdrew.</l>
<l>Then at their chieftain's summons came</l>
<l>The Vánars first in rank and fame,</l>
<l>A trusty brave and reverent band,</l>
<l>Meet e'en before a queen to stand.</l>
<l>They at his call made haste to bring</l>
<l>The litter of the glorious king.</l>
<l><q>Mount, O my friend.</q> Sugríva cried,</l>
<l>And straight Sumitrá's son complied.</l>
<l>Then took by Lakshmaṇ's side his place</l>
<l>The sovereign of the woodland race,</l>
<l>Upraised by Vánars, fleet and strong,</l>
<l>Who bore the glittering load along.</l>
<l>On high above his royal head</l>
<l>A paly canopy was spread,</l>
<l>And chouries white in many a hand</l>
<l>The forehead of the monarch fanned,</l>

<pb n="370"/><anchor id="Pg370"/>
<l>About the monarch went a throng</l>
<l>Of Vánar warriors brave and strong,</l>
<l>As onward to the mountain shade</l>
<l>Where Ráma dwelt his way he made.</l>
<l>Soon as the lovely spot he viewed</l>
<l>Where Ráma lived in solitude,</l>
<l>The Vánar monarch, far-renowed,</l>
<l>With Lakshmaṇ, lightly stepped to ground,</l>
<l>And to the son of Raghu went</l>
<l>Joining his raised hands reverent.</l>
<l>As their great leader raised his hands,</l>
<l>So suppliant stood the Vánar bands.</l>
<l>Well pleased the son of Raghu saw</l>
<l>Those legions, hushed in reverent awe,</l>
<l>Stand silent like the tranquil floods</l>
<l>That raise their hands of lotus buds.</l>
<l>But Ráma, when the king, to greet</l>
<l>His friend, had bowed him at his feet,</l>
<l>Raised him who ruled the Vánar race,</l>
<l>And held him in a close embrace:</l>
<l>Then, when his arms he had unknit,</l>
<l>Besought him by his side to sit,</l>
<l>And thus with gentle words the best</l>

<l>And every hour to pleasure cleaves,</l>

<l>His foe, the hollow of the hill;</l>
<l>Nor need I, King, again unfold</l>
<l>The wondrous tale already told.</l>
<l>Then, wandering forth, my way I took</l>
<l>By many a town and wood and brook.</l>
<l>I roamed the earth from place to place,</l>
<l>Till, like a mirror's polished face,</l>
<l>The whole broad disk, that lies between</l>

<l>I wandered first to eastern skies</l>

<l>Where lilies robed the lake and rill.</l>
<l>There metal dyes that hill<note place="foot">Udayagiri or the hill from which the

<l>Whence springs the sun to light the morn.</l>
<l>There, too, I viewed the Milky sea,</l>
<l>Where nymphs of heaven delight to be.</l>
<l>Then to the south I made my way</l>
<l>From regions of the rising day,</l>
<l>And roamed o'er Vindhya, where the breeze</l>
<l>Is odorous of sandal trees.</l>
<l>Still in my fear I found no rest:</l>
<l>I sought the regions of the west,</l>

<l>By many a lake and river's side.</l>

<l>They toiled unresting through the day:</l>

<l>Whom fervent zeal and holy rite</l>

<lg>
<l>Angad and Tára by his side,</l>
<l>Again rose Hanumán and tried</l>
<l>Each mountain cavern, dark and deep,</l>
<l>And stony pass and wooded steep,</l>
<l>The lion's and the tiger's home,</l>
<l>By rushing torrents white with foam.</l>
<l>Then with new ardour, south and west,</l>
<l>O'er Vindhya's height the search they pressed.</l>
<l>The day prescribed was near and they</l>
<l>Still wandered on their weary way.</l>
<l>They reached the southern land beset</l>
<l>With woody mountains like a net.</l>
<l>At length a mighty cave they spied</l>
<l>That opened in a mountain's side.</l>
<l>Where many a verdant creeper grew</l>
<l>And o'er the mouth its tendrils threw.</l>
<l>Thence issued crane, and swan, and drake,</l>
<l>And trooping birds that love the lake.</l>
<l>The Vánars rushed within to cool</l>
<l>Their fevered lips in spring or pool.</l>
<l>Vast was the cavern dark and dread,</l>
<l>Where not a ray of light was shed;</l>
<l>Yet not the more their eyesight failed,</l>
<pb n="382"/><anchor id="Pg382"/>
<l>Their courage sank or valour quailed.</l>
<l>On through the gloom the Vánars pressed</l>
<l>With hunger, thirst, and toil distressed,</l>
<l>Poor helpless wanderers, sad, forlorn,</l>
<l>With wasted faces wan and worn.</l>
<l>At length, when life seemed lost for aye,</l>
<l>They saw a splendour as of day,</l>
<l>A wondrous forest, fair and bright,</l>
<l>Where golden trees shot flamy light.</l>
<l>And lotus-covered pools were there</l>
<l>With pleasant waters fresh and fair,</l>
<l>And streams their rippling currents rolled</l>
<l>By seats of silver and of gold.</l>
<l>Fair houses reared their stately height</l>
<l>Of burnished gold and lazulite,</l>
<l>And glorious was the lustre thrown</l>
<l>Through lattices of precious stone.</l>
<l>And there were flowers and fruit on stems</l>
<l>Of coral decked with rarest gems,</l>
<l>And emerald leaves on silver trees,</l>
<l>And honeycomb and golden bees.</l>
<l>Then as the Vánars nearer drew,</l>
<l>A holy woman met their view,</l>
<l>Around her form was duly tied</l>
<l>A garment of the blackdeer's hide.<note place="foot">The skin of the black antelope was

<l>To Daṇḍak's tangled forest came</l>
<l>With his brave brother and his dame.</l>

<l>The giant Rávaṇ stole his spouse.</l>
<l>Our king Sugríva's orders send</l>

<l>We roamed the southern region o'er,</l>

<l>Then as our sad eyes looked around</l>

<l><q>On, comrades, to the cave,</q> I cried</l>
<l>And all within the portal hied.</l>
<l>Each clasping fast another's hand</l>

<l>They looked upon the boundless main</l>
<l>The awful seat of Varuṇ's reign.</l>
<l>And heard his waters roar and rave</l>
<l>Terrific with each crested wave.</l>
<l>Then, in the depths of sorrow drowned,</l>
<l>They sat upon the bosky ground,</l>
<l>And sadly, as they pondered, grieved</l>
<l>For days gone by and naught achieved.</l>
<l>Pain pierced them through with sharper sting</l>
<l>When, gazing on the trees of spring,</l>
<l>They saw each waving bough that showed</l>
<l>The treasures of its glorious load,</l>

<l>Come, let us all from food abstain,</l>

<l>Stern is our king and swift to ire,</l>
<l>Imperious, proud, and fierce like fire,</l>
<l>And ne'er will pardon us the crime</l>

<l>Far better thus to end our lives,</l>

<l>Think not Sugríva's wrath will spare</l>

<l>A hundred seasons passed away,</l>

<lg>
<l>Shouts of triumphant joy outrang</l>
<l>As to their feet the Vánars sprang:</l>
<l>And, on the mighty task intent,</l>
<l>Swift to the sea their steps they bent.</l>
<l>They stood and gazed upon the deep,</l>
<l>Whose billows with a roar and leap</l>
<l>On the sea banks ware wildly hurled,—</l>
<l>The mirror of the mighty world.</l>
<l>There on the strand the Vánars stayed</l>
<l>And with sad eyes the deep surveyed,</l>
<l>Here, as in play, his billows rose,</l>
<l>And there he slumbered in repose.</l>
<l>Here leapt the boisterous waters, high</l>
<l>As mountains, menacing the sky,</l>
<l>And wild infernal forms between</l>
<l>The ridges of the waves were seen.</l>
<pb n="391"/><anchor id="Pg391"/>
<l>They saw the billows rave and swell,</l>
<l>And their sad spirits sank and fell;</l>
<l>For ocean in their deep despair</l>
<l>Seemed boundless as the fields of air.</l>
<l>Then noble Angad spake to cheer</l>
<l>The Vánars and dispel their fear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Faint not: despair should never find</q></l>
<l>Admittance to a noble mind.</l>
<l>Despair, a serpent's mortal bite,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Benumbs the hero's power and might.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then passed the weary night, and all</l>
<l>Assembled at their prince's call,</l>
<l>And every lord of high estate</l>
<l>Was gathered round him for debate.</l>
<l>Bright was the chieftains' glorious band</l>
<l>Round Angad on the ocean strand,</l>
<l>As when the mighty Storm-Gods meet</l>
<l>Round Indra on his golden seat.</l>
<l>Then princely Angad looked on each,</l>
<l>And thus began his prudent speech:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What chief of all our host will leap</q></l>
<l>A hundred leagues across the deep?</l>
<l>Who, O illustrious Vánars, who</l>
<l>Will make Sugríva's promise true,</l>
<l>And from our weight of fear set free</l>
<l>The leaders of our band and me?</l>
<l>To whom, O warriors, shall we owe</l>
<l>A sweet release from pain and woe,</l>
<l>And proud success, and happy lives</l>
<l>With our dear children and our wives,</l>
<l>Again permitted by his grace</l>

<l><q rend="post">The king, to our sweet homes restored?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to the gathered lords he spoke;</l>
<l>But no reply the silence broke.</l>
<l>Then with a sterner voice he cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O chiefs, the nation's boast and pride,</q></l>
<l>Whom valour strength and power adorn,</l>
<l>Of most illustrious lineage born,</l>
<l>Where'er you will you force a way,</l>
<l>And none your rapid course can stay.</l>

<lg>
<l>But none of all the host was found</l>
<l>To clear the sea with desperate bound,</l>
<l>Though each, as Angad bade, declared</l>
<l>His proper power and what he dared.<note place="foot">Each chief comes forward
and says how far he can leap. Gaja says he can leap ten yojans. Gavaksha can leap twenty.
Gavaya thirty, and so on up to ninety.</note></l>
<l>Then spake good Jámbaván the sage,</l>
<l>Chief of them all for reverend age;</l>
<l><q rend="pre">I, Vánar chieftains, long ago</q></l>
<l>Limbs light to leap could likewise show,</l>

<l>Still task like this I may not slight,</l>
<l>When Ráma and our king unite.</l>
<l>So listen while I tell, O friends,</l>
<l>What lingering strength mine age attends.</l>
<l>If my poor leap may aught avail,</l>
<l>Of ninety leagues, I will not fail.</l>
<l>Far other strength in youth's fresh prime</l>
<l>I boasted, in the olden time,</l>
<l>When, at Prahláda's<note place="foot">Prahláda, the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu,

<l>I circled in my rapid flight</l>
<l>Lord Vishṇu, everlasting God,</l>
<l>When through the universe he trod.</l>
<l>But now my limbs are weak and old,</l>
<l>My youth is fled, its fire is cold,</l>

<l><q rend="post">In such a task were idle pain.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Angad due obeisance paid,</l>
<l>And to the chief his answer made:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Then I, ye noble Vánars, I</q></l>
<l>Myself the mighty leap will try:</l>
<l>Although perchance the power I lack</l>
<l><q rend="post">To leap from Lanká's island back.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus the impetuous chieftain cried,</l>
<l>And Jámbaván the sage replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Whate'er thy power and might may be,</q></l>
<l>This task, O Prince, is not for thee.</l>
<l>Kings go not forth themselves, but send</l>
<l>The servants who their best attend.</l>
<l>Thou art the darling and the boast,</l>
<l>The honoured lord of all the host.</l>
<l>In thee the root, O Angad, lies</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Báli's noble son replied:</l>

<l>O hero, art thou lingering still?</l>
<l>An Apsaras<note place="foot">A nymph of Paradise.</note> the fairest found</l>

<l>Anjaná was the name she bore,</l>

<l>In Vánar form on earth to dwell,</l>

<l>Of Kunjar monarch of the wild.</l>
<l>In youthful beauty wondrous fair,</l>
<l>A crown of flowers about her hair,</l>
<l>In silken robes of richest dye</l>
<l>She roamed the hills that kiss the sky.</l>
<l>Once in her tinted garments dressed</l>
<l>She stood upon the mountain crest,</l>
<l>The God of Wind beside her came,</l>
<l>And breathed upon the lovely dame.</l>
<l>And as he fanned her robe aside</l>
<l>The wondrous beauty that he eyed</l>
<l>In rounded lines of breast and limb</l>
<l>And neck and shoulder ravished him;</l>
<l>And captured by her peerless charms</l>
<l>He strained her in his amorous arms.</l>
<l>Then to the eager God she cried</l>
<l>In trembling accents, terrified:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Whose impious love has wronged a spouse</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">So constant in her nuptial vows?</q></l>
<l>He heard, and thus his answer made:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O, be not troubled, nor afraid,</q></l>
<l>But trust, and thou shalt know ere long</l>
<l>My love has done thee, sweet, no wrong,</l>
<l>So strong and brave and wise shall be</l>
<l>The glorious child I give to thee.</l>
<l>Might shall be his that naught can tire,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And limbs to spring as springs his sire.</q></l>
<l>Thus spoke the God; the conquered dame</l>
<l>Rejoiced in heart nor feared the shame.</l>
<l>Down in a cave beneath the earth</l>
<l>The happy mother gave thee birth.</l>
<l>Once o'er the summit of the wood</l>
<l>Before thine eyes the new sun stood.</l>
<l>Thou sprangest up in haste to seize</l>
<l>What seemed the fruitage of the trees.</l>
<l>Up leapt the child, a wondrous bound,</l>
<l>Three hundred leagues above the ground,</l>
<l>And, though the angered Day-God shot</l>
<l>His fierce beams on him, feared him not.</l>
<l>Then from the hand of Indra came</l>
<l>A red bolt winged with wrath and flame.</l>
<l>The child fell smitten on a rock,</l>
<l>His cheek was shattered by the shock,</l>
<l>Named Hanumán<note place="foot">Hanu or Hanú means jaw. Hanumán

<l>The wandering Wind-God saw thee lie</l>

<l>His fiery wrath no longer glowed,</l>

<l>That in the brunt of battle none</l>
<l>Should slay with steel the Wind-God's son.</l>
<l>Lord Indra, sovereign of the skies,</l>

<l>Like some strong husband of the cows,</l>

<l>For the bold task his soul has dared.</l>
<l>O'er gem-like grass that flashed and glowed</l>

<l>Roused by the thunder of his tread,</l>

<l>Tall trees he crushed or hurled aside,</l>

[I omit Canto V. which corresponds to chapter XI. in Gorresio's edition. That
scholar justly observes: <q>The eleventh chapter, Description of Evening, is certainly
the work of the Rhapsodists and an interpolation of later date. The chapter
might be omitted without any injury to the action of the poem, and besides the
metre, style, conceits and images differ from the general tenour of the poem;
and that continual repetition of the same sounds at the end of each hemistich which
is not exactly rime, but assonance, reveals the artificial labour of a more recent
age.</q> The following sample will probably be enough.

<l>The palace gates were guarded well</l>
<l>By many a Rákshas sentinel,</l>

<l>Who wait upon the robber fiend?</l>
<l>No battle fought, no might displayed,</l>
<l>In vain this anxious search is made;</l>
<l>Nor shall my steps, made slow by shame,</l>

<l>In every bower my feet have been,</l>

<l>Then rapid as the lightning's flame</l>

<l>Each lingering hope was cold and dead,</l>
<l>And thus within his heart he said:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Alas, my fruitless search is done:</q></l>
<l>Long have I toiled for Raghu's son;</l>
<l>And yet with all my care have seen</l>
<l>No traces of the ravished queen.</l>
<l>It may be, while the giant through</l>

<l>Slipped struggling from the robber's hold,</l>

<l>Then round the helpless Sítá drew</l>

Vedic divinities mentioned in the Rig-veda. In Ashṭaka I. Súkta XXXIV, the Rishi
Hiraṇyastúpa invoking the Aśvins says: Á Násatyá tribhirekádaśairiha devebniryátam: <q>O
Násatyas (Aśvins) come hither with the thrice eleven Gods.</q> And in Súkta XLV, the
Rishi Praskanva addressing his hymn to Agni (ignis, fire), thus invokes him: <q>Lord of
the red steeds, propitiated by our prayers lead hither the thirty-three Gods.</q> This
number must certainly have been the actual number in the early days of the Vedic
religion: although it appears probable enough that the thirty-three Vedic divinities
could not then be found co-ordinated in so systematic a way as they were arranged more
recently by the authors of the Upanishads. In the later ages of Bramanism the number went
on increasing without measure by successive mythical and religious creations which
peopled the Indian Olympus with abstract beings of every kind. But through lasting
veneration of the word of the Veda the custom regained of giving the name of <q>the
thirty-three Gods</q> to the immense phalanx of the multiplied deities.</q>

[I omit the 28th and 29th Cantos as an
unmistakeable interpolation. Instead of
advancing the story it goes back to Canto
XVII, containing a lamentation of Sítá
after Rávaṇ has left her, and describes the
the auspicious signs sent to cheer her, the
throbbing of her left eye, arm, and side.
The Canto is found in the Bengal recension.
Gorresio translates it. and observes:
<q>I think that Chapter XXVIII.—The
Auspicious Signs—is an addition, a later
interpolation by the Rhapsodists. It has
no bond of connexion either with what
precedes or follows it, and may be struck
out not only without injury to, but positively
to the advantage of the poem. The
metre in which this chapter is written
differs from that which is generally adopted
in the course of the poem.</q>]

to Ráma and bid him hasten to rescue
her. Hanumán replies as before that
there is no one on earth equal to Ráma,
who will soon come and destroy Rávaṇ.
There is not a new idea in the two Cantos:
all is reiteration.]

<l>The fourth alone can I achieve.<note place="foot">The expedients to vanquish an enemy

<q>This comparison of a great lake to the sky and of celestial to aquatic objects is one
of those ideas which the view and qualities of natural scenery awake in lively fancies.
Imagine one of those grand and splendid lakes of India covered with lotus blossoms,
furrowed by wild-ducks of the most vivid colours, mantled over here and there with
flowers and water weeds &amp;c. and it will be understood how the fancy of the poet could
readily compare to the sky radiant with celestial azure the blue expanse of the water, to
the soft light of the moon the inner hue of the lotus, to the splendour of the sun the
brilliant colours of the wild-fowl, to the stars the flowers, to the cloud the weeds that

the <q>honey-wood.</q></note> they came</l>
<l>That rivalled heavenly Nandan's<note place="foot">Indra's pleasure-ground or

<l>Where countless bees their honey stored,—</l>
<l>The pleasance of the Vánars' lord,</l>
<l>To every creature fenced and barred,</l>
<l>Which Dadhimukh was set to guard,</l>
<l>A noble Vánar, brave and bold,</l>
<l>Sugríva's uncle lofty-souled.</l>
<l>To Angad came with one accord</l>
<l>The Vánars, and besought their lord</l>
<l>That they those honeyed stores might eat</l>
<l>That made the grove so passing sweet.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He gave consent: they sought the trees</l>
<l>Thronged with innumerable bees.</l>
<l>They rifled all the treasured store,</l>
<l>And ate the fruit the branches bore,</l>
<l>And still as they prolonged the feast</l>
<l>Their merriment and joy increased.</l>
<l>Drunk with the sweets, they danced and bowed,</l>
<l>They wildly sang, they laughed aloud,</l>
<l>Some climbed and sprang from tree to tree,</l>
<l>Some sat and chattered in their glee.</l>
<l>Some scaled the trees which creepers crowned,</l>
<l>And rained the branches to the ground.</l>
<l>There with loud laugh a Vánar sprang</l>
<l>Close to his friend who madly sang,</l>
<l>In doleful mood another crept</l>
<l>To mix his tears with one who wept.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Dadhimukh with fury viewed</l>
<l>The intoxicated multitude.</l>
<l>He looked upon the rifled shade,</l>
<l>And all the ruin they had made;</l>
<l>Then called with angry voice, and strove</l>
<l>To save the remnant of the grove.</l>
<l>But warning cries and words were spurned,</l>
<l>And angry taunt and threat returned.</l>
<l>Then fierce and wild contention rose:</l>
<l>With furious words he mingled blows.</l>
<l>They by no shame or fear withheld,</l>
<l>By drunken mood and ire impelled,</l>
<l>Used claws, and teeth, and hands, and beat</l>
<l>The keeper under trampling feet.</l>

<p>
[Three Cantos consisting of little but
repetitions are omitted. Dadhimukh escapes
from the infuriated monkeys and
hastens to Sugríva to report their misconduct.
Sugríva infers that Hanumán and
his band have been successful in their
search, and that the exuberance of spirits
and the mischief complained of, are but
the natural expression of their joy. Dadhimukh
obtains little sympathy from
Sugríva, and is told to return and send
the monkeys on with all possible speed.]

<l>Thence Daśaratha's son beheld</l>

<l>The Vánar legions reached the main,</l>
<l>And stood in many a marshalled band</l>
<l>On loud-resounding Ocean's strand.</l>
<l>To the fair wood that fringed the tide</l>
<l>Came Daśaratha's son, and cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">At length, my lord Sugríva, we</q></l>

<l>And one great thought, still-vexing, how</l>

<l>By trees o'ershadowed stayed the host,</l>
<l>That seemed in glittering lines to be</l>
<l>The bright waves of a second sea.</l>
<l>Then from the shore the captains gazed</l>
<l>On billows which the breezes raised</l>

<l>O'er Varuṇ's realm, the Asurs' home:<note place="foot">The Asurs or demons dwell

<l>The sea that laughed with foam, and danced</l>
<l>With waves whereon the sunbeams glanced:</l>
<l>Where, when the light began to fade,</l>
<l>Huge crocodiles and monsters played;</l>
<l>And, when the moon went up the sky,</l>
<l>The troubled billows rose on high</l>
<l>From the wild watery world whereon</l>
<l>A thousand moons reflected shone:</l>
<l>Where awful serpents swam and showed</l>
<l>Their fiery crests which flashed and glowed,</l>
<l>Illumining the depths of hell,</l>
<l>The prison where the demons dwell.</l>
<l>The eye, bewildered, sought in vain</l>
<l>The bounding line of sky and main:</l>
<l>Alike in shade, alike in glow</l>
<l>Were sky above and sea below.</l>
<l>There wave-like clouds by clouds were chased,</l>
<l>Here cloud-like billows roared and raced:</l>
<l>Then shone the stars, and many a gem</l>
<l>That lit the waters answered them.</l>
<l>They saw the great-souled Ocean stirred</l>
<l>To frenzy by the winds, and heard,</l>
<l>Loud as ten thousand drums, the roar</l>
<l>Of wild waves dashing on the shore.</l>
<l>They saw him mounting to defy</l>

<lg>
<l>But when the giant king surveyed</l>
<l>His glorious town in ruin laid,</l>
<l>And each dire sign of victory won</l>
<l>By Hanumán the Wind-God's son,</l>
<l>He vailed his angry eyes oppressed</l>
<l>By shame, and thus his lords addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The Vánar spy has passed the gate</q></l>
<l>Of Lanká long inviolate,</l>
<l>Eluded watch and ward, and seen</l>
<l>With his bold eyes the captive queen.</l>
<l>My royal roof with flames is red,</l>
<l>The bravest of my lords are dead,</l>
<l>And the fierce Vánar in his hate</l>
<l>Has left our city desolate.</l>
<l>Now ponder well the work that lies</l>
<l>Before us, ponder and advise.</l>
<l>With deep-observing judgment scan</l>
<l>The peril, and mature a plan.</l>
<l>From counsel, sages say, the root,</l>
<l>Springs victory, most glorious fruit.</l>
<l>First ranks the king, when woe impends</l>
<l>Who seeks the counsel of his friends,</l>
<l>Of kinsmen ever faithful found,</l>
<l>Or those whose hopes with his are bound,</l>
<l>Then with their aid his strength applies,</l>
<l>And triumphs in his enterprise.</l>
<l>Next ranks the prince who plans alone,</l>
<l>No counsel seeks to aid his own,</l>
<l>Weighs loss and gain and wrong and right,</l>
<l>And seeks success with earnest might.</l>
<l>Unwisest he who spurns delays,</l>
<l>Who counts no cost, no peril weighs,</l>
<l>Speeds to his aim, defying fate,</l>
<l>And risks his all, precipitate.</l>
<l>Thus too in counsel sages find</l>
<l>A best, a worst, a middle kind.</l>
<l>When gathered counsellors explore</l>
<l>The way by light of holy lore,</l>
<l>And all from first to last agree,</l>
<l>Is the best counsel of the three.</l>
<l>Next, if debate first waxes high,</l>
<l>And each his chosen plan would try</l>
<l>Till all agree at last, we deem</l>
<l>This counsel second in esteem.</l>
<l>Worst of the three is this, when each</l>
<l>Assails with taunt his fellow's speech;</l>
<l>When all debate, and no consent</l>
<l>Concludes the angry argument.</l>
<l>Consult then, lords; my task shall be</l>
<l>To crown with act your wise decree.</l>
<l>With thousands of his wild allies</l>
<l>The vengeful Ráma hither hies;</l>

<l>Still Rávaṇ's haughty heart rebelled,</l>
<l>The counsel of the wise repelled,</l>
<l>And, as his breast with passion burned,</l>
<l>His thoughts again to Sítá turned.</l>
<l>Thus, to each sign of danger blind,</l>
<l>To love and war he still inclined.</l>
<l>Then mounted he his car that glowed</l>
<l>With gems and golden net, and rode</l>
<l>Where, gathered at the monarch's call,</l>
<l>The nobles filled the council hall.</l>
<l>A host of warriors bright and gay</l>
<l>With coloured robes and rich array,</l>
<l>With shield and mace and spear and sword,</l>
<l>Followed the chariot of their lord.</l>
<l>Mid the loud voice of shells and beat</l>
<l>Of drums he raced along the street,</l>
<l>And, ere he came, was heard afar</l>
<l>The rolling thunder of his car.</l>
<l>He reached the doors: the nobles bent</l>
<l>Their heads before him reverent:</l>
<l>And, welcomed with their loud acclaim,</l>
<l>Within the glorious hall he came.</l>
<l>He sat upon a royal seat</l>
<l>With golden steps beneath his feet,</l>
<l>And bade the heralds summon all</l>
<l>His captains to the council hall.</l>
<l>The heralds heard the words he spake,</l>
<l>And sped from house to house to wake</l>
<l>The giants where they slept or spent</l>
<l>The careless hours in merriment.</l>
<l>These heard the summons and obeyed:</l>
<l>From chamber, grove, and colonnade,</l>
<l>On elephants or cars they rode,</l>
<l>Or through the streets impatient strode.</l>
<l>As birds on rustling pinions fly</l>
<l>Through regions of the darkened sky,</l>
<l>Thus cars and mettled coursers through</l>
<l>The crowded streets of Lanká flew.</l>
<l>The council hall was reached, and then,</l>
<l>As lions seek their mountain den,</l>
<l>Through massy doors that opened wide,</l>
<l>With martial stalk the captains hied.</l>
<l>Welcomed with honour as was meet</l>
<l>They stooped to press their monarch's feet,</l>
<pb n="435"/><anchor id="Pg435"/>
<l>And each a place in order found</l>
<l>On stool, on cushion, or the ground.</l>
<l>Nor did the sage Vibhishaṇ long</l>
<l>Delay to join the noble throng.</l>
<l>High on a car that shone like flame</l>
<l>With gold and flashing gems he came,</l>
<l>Drew near and spoke his name aloud,</l>

<lg>
<l>The king in counsel unsurpassed</l>
<l>His eye around the synod cast,</l>
<l>And fierce Prahasta, first and best</l>
<l>Of all his captains, thus addressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Brave master of each warlike art,</q></l>
<l>Arouse thee and perform thy part.</l>
<l>Array thy fourfold forces<note place="foot">Consisting of warriors on elephants,
warriors in chariots, charioteers, and infantry.</note> well</l>
<l><q rend="post">To guard our isle and citadel.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The captain of the hosts obeyed,</l>
<l>The troops with prudent skill arrayed;</l>
<l>Then to the hall again he hied,</l>
<l>And stood before the king and cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Each inlet to the town is closed</q></l>
<l>Without, within, are troops disposed.</l>
<l>With fearless heart thine aim pursue</l>
<l><q rend="post">And do the deed thou hast in view.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke Prahasta in the zeal</l>
<l>That moved him for the kingdom's weal.</l>
<l>And thus the monarch, who pursued</l>
<l>His own delight, his speech renewed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">In ease and bliss, in toil and pain,</q></l>
<l>In doubts of duty, pleasure, gain,</l>
<l>Your proper path I need not tell,</l>
<l>For of yourselves ye know it well.</l>
<l>The Storm-Gods, Moon, and planets bring</l>
<l>New glory to their heavenly king,<note place="foot">Indra, generally represented as
surrounded by the Maruts or Storm-Gods.</note></l>
<l>And, ranged about your monarch, ye</l>
<l>Give joy and endless fame to me.</l>
<l>My secret counsel have I kept,</l>
<l>While senseless Kumbhakarṇa slept.</l>
<l>Six months the warrior's slumbers last</l>
<l>And bind his torpid senses fast;</l>
<l>But now his deep repose he breaks,</l>
<l>The best of all our champions wakes.</l>
<l>I captured, Ráma's heart to wring,</l>
<l>This daughter of Videha's king.</l>
<l>And brought her from that distant land<note place="foot">Janasthán, where Ráma lived
as an ascetic.</note></l>
<l>Where wandered many a Rákshas band.</l>
<l>Disdainful still my love she spurns,</l>
<l>Still from each prayer and offering turns,</l>
<l>Yet in all lands beneath the sun</l>
<l>No dame may rival Sítá, none,</l>
<l>Her dainty waist is round and slight,</l>
<l>Her cheek like autumn's moon is bright,</l>
<l>And she like fruit in graven gold</l>
<l>Mocks her<note place="foot">Máyá, regarded as the paragon of
female beauty, was the creation of Maya the chief artificer of the Daityas or
Dánavs.</note> whom Maya framed of old.</l>
<l>Faultless in form, how firmly tread</l>
<l>Her feet whose soles are rosy red!</l>
<l>Ah, as I gaze her beauty takes</l>
<l>My spirit, and my passion wakes.</l>
<l>Looking for Ráma far away</l>
<l>She sought with tears a year's delay</l>
<l>Nor gazing on her love-lit eye</l>
<l>Could I that earnest prayer deny.</l>
<l>But baffled hopes and vain desire</l>
<l>At length my patient spirit tire.</l>
<l>How shall the sons of Raghu sweep</l>
<l>To vengeance o'er the pathless deep?</l>
<l>How shall they lead the Vánar train</l>
<l>Across the monster-teeming main?</l>
<l>One Vánar yet could find a way</l>
<l>To Lanká's town, and burn and slay.</l>
<l>Take counsel then, remembering still</l>
<l>That we from men need fear no ill;</l>
<l>And give your sentence in debate,</l>
<l>For matchless is the power of fate.</l>
<l>Assailed by you the Gods who dwell</l>
<l>In heaven beneath our fury fell.</l>
<l>And shall we fear these creatures bred</l>
<l>In forests, by Sugríva led?</l>
<l>E'en now on ocean's farther strand,</l>
<l>The sons of Daśaratha stand,</l>
<l>And follow, burning to attack</l>
<l>Their giant foes, on Sítá's track.</l>
<l>Consult then, lords for ye are wise:</l>
<l>A seasonable plan devise.</l>
<l>The captive lady to retain,</l>
<l>And triumph when the foes are slain.</l>
<l>No power can bring across the foam</l>
<l>Those Vánars to our island home;</l>
<l>Or if they madly will defy</l>
<l><q rend="post">Our conquering might, they needs must die.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Kumbhakarṇa's anger woke,</l>
<l>And wroth at Rávaṇ's words he spoke:</l>

<l>One wound, thy mortal bane, could deal.</l>
<l>But, Rávaṇ, as the deed is done,</l>

<l>This arm, O rover of the night,</l>
<l>Thy foemen to the earth shall smite,</l>
<l>Though Indra with the Lord of Flame,</l>

<l>E'en Indra, monarch of the skies,</l>
<l>Would dread my club and mountain size,</l>
<l>Shrink from these teeth and quake to hear</l>
<l>The thunders of my voice of fear.</l>
<l>No second dart shall Ráma cast:</l>
<l>The first he aims shall be the last.</l>

<lg>

<l>Like Naliní<note place="foot">The Lotus River, a branch of the

<l>On him those arrows will I turn,</l>

<l>To Raghu's sons Vibhishaṇ fled.<note place="foot">This desertion to the enemy is
somewhat abrupt, and is narrated with brevity not usual with Válmíki. In the Bengal
recension the preceding speakers and speeches differ considerably from those
given in the text which I follow. Vibhishaṇ is kicked from his seat by Rávaṇ, and
then, after telling his mother what has happened, he flies to Mount Kailása
where he has an interview with Śiva, and by his advice seeks Ráma and the Vánar
army.</note></l>
<l>Their eyes the Vánar leaders raised</l>
<l>And on the air-borne Rákhshas gazed,</l>
<l>Bright as a thunderbolt, in size</l>
<l>Like Meru's peak that cleaves the skies.</l>
<l>In gorgeous panoply arrayed</l>
<l>Like Indra's self he stood displayed,</l>
<l>And four attendants brave and bold</l>
<l>Shone by their chief in mail and gold.</l>
<l>Sugríva then with dark surmise</l>
<l>Bent on their forms his wondering eyes,</l>
<l>And thus in hasty words confessed</l>
<l>The anxious doubt that moved his breast:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Look, look ye Vánars, and beware:</q></l>

<pb n="439"/><anchor id="Pg439"/>
<l>Soon as his warning speech they heard,</l>
<l>The Vánar chieftains undeterred</l>
<l>Seized fragments of the rock and trees,</l>
<l>And made reply in words like these:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">We wait thy word: the order give,</q></l>
<l>And these thy foes shall cease to live.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile Vibhishaṇ with the four</l>

<l>Sugríva and the chiefs he spied,</l>
<l>And raised his mighty voice and cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">From Rávaṇ, lord of giants, I</q></l>
<l>His brother, named Vibhishaṇ, fly.</l>
<l>From Janasthán he stole the child</l>

<l>I bade him, plied with varied lore,</l>
<l>His hapless prisoner restore.</l>
<l>But he, by Fate to ruin sent,</l>
<l>No credence to my counsel lent,</l>
<l>Mad as the fevered wretch who sees</l>

<l>He scorned the sage advice I gave,</l>
<l>He spurned me like a base-born slave.</l>
<l>I left my children and my wife,</l>
<l>And fly to Raghu's son for life.</l>
<l>I pray thee, Vánar chieftain, speed</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Rákshas ceased: Sugríva hied</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Śarabha the bold and brave</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then he whose heart was rich in store</l>

<lg>
<l>Then Ráma's rising doubt was stilled,</l>
<l>And friendly thoughts his bosom filled.</l>
<l>Thus, deep in Scripture's lore, he spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The suppliant will I ne'er forsake,</q></l>
<l>Nor my protecting aid refuse</l>
<l>When one in name of friendship sues.</l>
<l>Though faults and folly blot his fame,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: Sugríva bowed his head</l>
<l>And pondered for a while, and said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Past number be his faults or few,</q></l>
<l>What think ye of the Rákshas who,</l>

<l><q rend="post">True friendship in his faithless kind?</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Raghu heard his speech:</l>
<l>He cast a hasty look on each</l>
<l>Of those brave Vánar chiefs, and while</l>
<l>Upon his lips there played a smile,</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ turned and thus expressed</l>
<l>The thoughts that moved his gallant breast:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Well versed in Scripture's lore, and sage</q></l>
<l>And duly reverent to age,</l>
<l>Is he, with long experience stored,</l>
<l>Who counsels like this Vánar lord.</l>
<l>Yet here, methinks, for searching eyes</l>
<l>Some deeper, subtler matter lies.</l>
<l>To you and all the world are known</l>
<l>The perils of a monarch's throne,</l>
<l>While foe and stranger, kith and kin</l>
<l>By his misfortune trust to win.</l>
<l>By hope of such advantage led,</l>
<l>Vibhishaṇ o'er the sea has fled.</l>
<l>He in his brother's stead would reign,</l>
<l>And our alliance seeks to gain;</l>
<l>And we his offer may embrace,</l>
<l>A stranger and of alien race.</l>
<l>But if he comes a spy and foe,</l>
<l>What power has he to strike a blow</l>
<l>In furtherance of his close design?</l>
<l>What is his strength compared with mine?</l>
<l>And can I, Vánar King, forget</l>
<l>The great, the universal debt,</l>
<l>Ever to aid and welcome those</l>
<l>Who pray for shelter, friends or foes?</l>
<l>Hast thou not heard the deathless praise</l>

<l>Who conquering his fear and hate</l>
<l>Welcomed the slayer of his mate,</l>
<l>And gave a banquet, to refresh</l>

<l>Now hear me, Vánar King, rehearse</l>
<l>What Kaṇdu<note place="foot">In <ref target="CantoII-XXI">Book II, Canto XXI</ref>,
Kaṇdu is mentioned by Ráma as an example of filial obedience. At the command of his
father he is said to have killed a cow.</note> spoke in ancient verse,</l>
<l>Saint Kaṇva's son who loved the truth</l>
<l>And clave to virtue from his youth:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Strike not the suppliant when he stands</q></l>
<l>And asks thee with beseeching hands</l>
<l>For shelter: strike him not although</l>
<l>He were thy father's mortal foe.</l>
<l>No, yield him, be he proud or meek,</l>
<l>The shelter which he comes to seek,</l>
<l>And save thy foeman, if the deed</l>
<l><q rend="post">Should cost thy life, in desperate need.</q></l>
<l>And shall I hear the wretched cry,</l>
<l>And my protecting aid deny?</l>
<l>Shall I a suppliant's prayer refuse,</l>
<l>And heaven and glory basely lose?</l>
<l>No, I will do for honour sake</l>
<l>E'en as the holy Kaṇdu spake,</l>
<l>Preserve a hero's name from stain,</l>
<l>And bliss in heaven and glory gain.</l>
<l>Bound by a solemn vow I sware</l>
<l>That all my saving help should share</l>
<l>Who sought me in distress and cried,</l>
<l><q>Thou art my hope, and none beside.</q></l>
<l>Then go, I pray thee, Vánar King,</l>
<l>Vibhishaṇ to my presence bring,</l>
<l>Yea, were he Rávaṇ's self, my vow</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: the Vánar king approved;</l>

<lg>
<l>When Raghu's son had owned his claim</l>

<l>His hands in reverence Ráma raised</l>
<l>And southward o'er the ocean gazed;</l>
<l>Then on the sacred grass that made</l>
<l>His lowly couch his limbs he laid.</l>
<l>His head on that strong arm reclined</l>
<l>Which Sítá, best of womankind,</l>
<l>Had loved in happier days to hold</l>
<l>With soft arms decked with pearls and gold.</l>
<l>Then rising from his bed of grass,</l>
<l><q>This day,</q> he cried, <q rend="pre">the host shall pass</q></l>
<l>Triumphant to the southern shore,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Or Ocean's self shall be no more.</q></l>
<l>Thus vowing in his constant breast</l>
<l>Again he turned him to his rest,</l>
<l>And there, his eyes in slumber closed,</l>
<l>Silent beside the sea reposed.</l>
<l>Thrice rose the Day-God thrice he set,</l>
<l>The lord of Ocean came not yet,</l>
<l>Thrice came the night, but Raghu's son</l>
<l>No answer by his service won.</l>
<l>To Lakshmaṇ thus the hero cried,</l>
<l>His eyes aflame with wrath and pride:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">In vain the softer gifts that grace</q></l>

<l>The world to him its honour pays</l>
<l>Whose ready tongue himself can praise,</l>

<l>Whose hand is ever raised to smite.</l>
<l>Each milder art is tried in vain:</l>
<l>It wins no glory, but disdain.</l>
<l>And victory owns no softer charm</l>
<l>Than might which nerves a warrior's arm.</l>
<l>My humble suit is still denied</l>
<l>By Ocean's overweening pride.</l>
<l>This day the monsters of the deep</l>
<l>In throes of death shall wildly leap.</l>
<l>My shafts shall rend the serpents curled</l>
<l>In caverns of the watery world,</l>
<l>Disclose each sunless depth and bare</l>
<l>The tangled pearl and coral there.</l>
<l>Away with mercy! at a time</l>
<l>Like this compassion is a crime.</l>
<l>Welcome, the battle and the foe!</l>
<l>My bow! my arrows and my bow!</l>
<l>This day the Vánars' feet shall tread</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Red flashed his eyes with angry glow:</l>
<l>He stood and grasped his mighty bow,</l>
<l>Terrific as the fire of doom</l>
<l>Whose quenchless flames the world consume.</l>
<l>His clanging cord the archer drew,</l>
<l>And swift the fiery arrows flew</l>
<l>Fierce as the flashing levin sent</l>
<l>By him who rules the firmament.</l>
<l>Down through the startled waters sped</l>
<l>Each missile with its flaming head.</l>
<l>The foamy billows rose and sank,</l>
<l>And dashed upon the trembling bank.</l>
<l>Sea monsters of tremendous form</l>

<l>With angry menace Ráma, best</l>

<l>Thy channels will I dry and drain.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke the warrior, and prepared</l>
<l>The mortal shaft which never spared,</l>
<l>Known mystic weapon, by the name</l>
<l>Of Brahmá, red with quenchless flame.</l>
<l>Great terror, as he strained the bow,</l>
<l>Struck heaven above and earth below.</l>
<l>Through echoing skies the thunder pealed,</l>
<l>And startled mountains rocked and reeled,</l>
<l>The earth was black with sudden night</l>
<l>And heaven was blotted from the sight.</l>
<l>Then ever and anon the glare</l>
<l>Of meteors shot through murky air,</l>
<l>And with a wild terrific sound</l>
<l>Red lightnings struck the trembling ground.</l>
<l>In furious gusts the fierce wind blew:</l>
<l>Tall trees it shattered and o'erthrew,</l>
<l>And, smiting with a giant's stroke,</l>
<l>Huge masses from the mountain broke.</l>
<l>A cry of terror long and shrill</l>
<l>Came from each valley, plain, and hill.</l>
<l>Each ruined dale, each riven peak</l>
<l>Re-echoed with a wail or shriek.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Raghu's son undaunted gazed,</l>
<l>The waters of the deep were raised,</l>
<l>And, still uplifted more and more,</l>
<l>Leapt in wild flood upon the shore.</l>
<l>Still Ráma looked upon the tide</l>
<l>And kept his post unterrified.</l>
<l>Then from the seething flood upreared</l>
<l>Majestic Ocean's form appeared,</l>
<l>As rising from his eastern height</l>
<l>Springs through the sky the Lord of Light.</l>
<l>Attendant on their monarch came</l>
<l>Sea serpents with their eyes aflame.</l>
<l>Like lazulite mid burning gold</l>
<l>His form was wondrous to behold.</l>
<l>Bright with each fairest precious stone</l>
<l>A chain about his neck was thrown.</l>
<l>Calm shone his lotus eyes beneath</l>
<l>The blossoms of his heavenly wreath,</l>
<l>And many a pearl and sea-born gem</l>
<l>Flashed in the monarch's diadem.</l>
<l>There Gangá, tributary queen,</l>
<l>And Sindhu<note place="foot">The Indus.</note> by his lord, were seen,</l>
<pb n="444"/><anchor id="Pg444"/>
<l>And every stream and brook renowned</l>
<l>In ancient story girt him round.</l>
<l>Then, as the waters rose and swelled,</l>
<l>The king with suppliant hands upheld,</l>
<l>His glorious head to Ráma bent</l>
<l>And thus addressed him reverent:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Air, ether, fire, earth, water, true</q></l>
<l>To nature's will, their course pursue;</l>
<l>And I, as ancient laws ordain,</l>
<l>Unfordable must still remain.</l>
<l>Yet, Raghu's son, my counsel hear:</l>
<l>I ne'er for love or hope or fear</l>
<l>Will pile my waters in a heap</l>
<l>And leave a pathway through the deep.</l>
<l>Still shall my care for thee provide</l>
<l>An easy passage o'er the tide,</l>
<l>And like a city's paven street</l>
<l><q rend="post">Shall be the road beneath thy feet.</q></l>
<l>He ceased: and Ráma spoke again:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">This spell is ne'er invoked in vain.</q></l>
<l>Where shall the magic shaft, to spend</l>
<l><q rend="post">The fury of its might, descend?</q></l>

<l>With all its fury to the north,</l>
<l>Where sacred Drumakulya lies,</l>
<l>Whose glory with thy glory vies.</l>
<l>There dwells a wild Abhíra<note place="foot">Cowherds, sprung from a Bráhman
and a woman of the medical tribe, the modern Ahírs.</note> race,</l>
<l>As vile in act as foul of face,</l>
<l>Fierce Dasyus<note place="foot">Barbarians or outcasts.</note> who delight in ill,</l>
<l>And drink my tributary rill.</l>
<l>My soul no longer may endure</l>
<l>Their neighbourhood and touch impure.</l>
<l>At these, O son of Raghu, aim</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thine arrow with the quenchless flame.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift from the bow, as Ráma drew</l>
<l>His cord, the fiery arrow flew.</l>
<l>Earth groaned to feel the wound, and sent</l>
<l>A rush of water through the rent;</l>
<l>And famed for ever is the well</l>
<l>Of Vraṇa<note place="foot"><foreign lang="sa"
rend="font-style: italic">Vraṇa</foreign> means wound or rent.</note>
where the arrow fell.</l>
<l>Then every brook and lake beside</l>
<l>Throughout the region Ráma dried.</l>
<l>But yet he gave a boon to bless</l>
<l>And fertilize the wilderness:</l>
<l>No fell disease should taint the air,</l>
<l>And sheep and kine should prosper there:</l>
<l>Earth should produce each pleasant root,</l>
<l>The stately trees should bend with fruit;</l>
<l>Oil, milk, and honey should abound,</l>
<l>And fragrant herbs should clothe the ground.</l>
<l>Then spake the king of brooks and seas</l>
<l>To Raghu's son in words like these:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now let a wondrous task be done</q></l>
<l>By Nala, Viśvakarmá's son,</l>
<l>Who, born of one of Vánar race,</l>
<l>Inherits by his father's grace</l>
<l>A share of his celestial art.</l>
<l>Call Nala to perform his part,</l>
<l>And he, divinely taught and skilled,</l>
<l><q rend="post">A bridge athwart the sea shall build.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke and vanished. Nala, best</l>
<l>Of Vánar chiefs, the king addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O'er the deep sea where monsters play</q></l>
<l>A bridge, O Ráma, will I lay;</l>
<l>For, sharer of my father's skill,</l>
<l>Mine is the power and mine the will.</l>
<l>'Tis vain to try each gentler art</l>
<l>To bribe and soothe the thankless heart;</l>
<l>In vain on such is mercy spent;</l>
<l>It yields to naught but punishment.</l>
<l>Through fear alone will Ocean now</l>
<l>A passage o'er his waves allow.</l>
<l>My mother, ere she bore her son,</l>
<l>This boon from Viśvakarmá won:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Mandarí, thy child shall be</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">In skill and glory next to me.</q></l>

<l>Command the Vánar hosts to lay</l>
<l><q rend="post">Foundations for the bridge to-day.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: and swift at Ráma's hest</l>
<l>Up sprang the Vánars from their rest,</l>
<l>The mandate of the king obeyed</l>
<l>And sought the forest's mighty shade.</l>
<l>Unrooted trees to earth they threw,</l>
<l>And to the sea the timber drew.</l>
<l>The stately palm was bowed and bent,</l>
<l>Aśokas from the ground were rent,</l>
<l>And towering Sáls and light bamboos,</l>
<l>And trees with flowers of varied hues,</l>
<l>With loveliest creepers wreathed and crowned,</l>
<l>Shook, reeled, and fell upon the ground.</l>
<l>With mighty engines piles of stone</l>
<l>And seated hills were overthrown:</l>
<l>Unprisoned waters sprang on high,</l>
<l>In rain descending from the sky:</l>
<l>And ocean with a roar and swell</l>
<l>Heaved wildly when the mountains fell.</l>
<l>Then the great bridge of wondrous strength</l>
<l>Was built, a hundred leagues in length.</l>
<l>Rocks huge as autumn clouds bound fast</l>
<l>With cordage from the shore were cast,</l>
<l>And fragments of each riven hill,</l>
<l>And trees whose flowers adorned them still.</l>
<l>Wild was the tumult, loud the din</l>
<l>As ponderous rocks went thundering in.</l>
<l>Ere set of sun, so toiled each crew,</l>
<l>Ten leagues and four the structure grew;</l>
<l>The labours of the second day</l>
<l>Gave twenty more of ready way,</l>
<l>And on the fifth, when sank the sun,</l>
<l>The whole stupendous work was done.</l>
<l>O'er the broad way the Vánars sped,</l>
<l>Nor swayed it with their countless tread.</l>
<pb n="445"/><anchor id="Pg445"/>
<l>Exultant on the ocean strand</l>
<l>Vibhishaṇ stood, and, mace in hand,</l>
<l>Longed eager for the onward way,</l>
<l>And chafed impatient at delay.</l>
<l>Then thus to Ráma trained and tried</l>
<l>In battle King Sugríva cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Come, Hanumán's broad back ascend;</q></l>
<l>Let Angad help to Lakshmaṇ lend.</l>
<l>These high above the sea shall bear</l>
<l><q rend="post">Their burthen through the ways of air.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So, with Sugríva, borne o'erhead</l>
<l>Ikshváku's sons the legions led.</l>
<l>Behind, the Vánar hosts pursued</l>
<l>Their march in endless multitude.</l>
<l>Some skimmed the surface of the wave,</l>
<l>To some the air a passage gave.</l>
<l>Amid their ceaseless roar the sound</l>
<l>Of Ocean's fearful voice was drowned,</l>
<l>As o'er the bridge by Nala planned</l>
<l>They hastened on to Lanká's strand,</l>
<l>Where, by the pleasant brooks, mid trees</l>
<l>Loaded with fruit, they took their ease.</l>

<l>That army of the bold and brave,</l>
<l>As from the sea it marched away</l>

<lg>
<l>When Ráma and the host he led</l>
<l>Across the sea had safely sped,</l>
<l>Thus Rávaṇ, moved by wrath and pride,</l>
<l>To Śuka and to Sáraṇ cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O counsellors, the Vánar host</q></l>

<l>And Daśaratha's son has wrought</l>

<l>The strength and number of the foe.</l>
<l>Go ye, to Ráma's host repair</l>
<l>And count me all the legions there.</l>
<l>Learn well what power each captain leads</l>
<l>His name and fame for warlike deeds.</l>
<l>Learn by what artist's wondrous aid</l>
<l>That bridge athwart the sea was made;</l>
<l>Learn how the Vánar host came o'er</l>
<l>And halted on the island shore.</l>
<l>Mark Ráma son of Raghu well;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: then swift in Vánar guise</l>
<l>Forth on their errand sped the spies.</l>
<l>They reached the Vánars, and, dismayed,</l>
<l>Their never-ending lines surveyd:</l>
<l>Nor would they try, in mere despair,</l>
<l>To count the countless legions there,</l>
<pb n="447"/><anchor id="Pg447"/>
<l>That crowded valley, plain and hill,</l>
<l>That pressed about each cave and rill.</l>
<l>Though sea-like o'er the land were spread</l>
<l>The endless hosts which Ráma led,</l>
<l>The bridge by thousands yet was lined,</l>
<l>And eager myriads pressed behind.</l>
<l>But sage Vibhishaṇ's watchful eyes</l>
<l>Had marked the giants in disguise.</l>
<l>He gave command the pair to seize,</l>
<l>And told the tale in words like these:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">O Ráma these, well known erewhile,</q></l>
<l>Are giant sons of Lanká's isle,</l>
<l>Two counsellors of Rávaṇ sent</l>
<l><q rend="post">To watch the invading armament.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vibhishaṇ ceased: at Ráma's look</l>
<l>The Rákshas envoys quailed and shook;</l>
<l>Then suppliant hand to hand they pressed</l>
<l>And thus Ikshváku's son addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O Ráma, bear the truth we speak:</q></l>
<l>Our monarch Rávaṇ bade us seek</l>
<l>The Vánar legions and survey</l>
<l><q rend="post">Their numbers, strength, and vast array.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma, friend and hope and guide</l>
<l>Of suffering creatures, thus replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">Now giants, if your eyes have scanned</q></l>
<l>Our armies, numbering every band,</l>
<l>Marked lord and chief, and gazed their fill,</l>
<l>Return to Rávaṇ when ye will.</l>
<l>If aught remain, if aught anew</l>
<l>Ye fain would scan with closer view,</l>
<l>Vibhishaṇ, ready at your call,</l>
<l>Will lead you forth and show you all.</l>
<l>Think not of bonds and capture; fear</l>
<l>No loss of life, no peril here:</l>
<l>For, captive, helpless and unarmed,</l>
<l>An envoy never should be harmed.</l>
<l>Again to Lanká's town repair,</l>
<l>Speed to the giant monarch there,</l>
<l>And be these words to Rávaṇ told,</l>
<l>Fierce brother of the Lord of Gold:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Now, tyrant, tremble for thy sin:</q></l>
<l>Call up thy friends, thy kith and kin,</l>
<l>And let the power and might be seen</l>
<l>Which made thee bold to steal my queen.</l>
<l>To-morrow shall thy mournful eye</l>
<l>Behold thy bravest warriors die,</l>
<l>And Lanká's city, tower and wall,</l>
<l>Struck by my fiery shafts, will fall.</l>
<l>Then shall my vengeful blow descend</l>
<l>Its rage on thee and thine to spend,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake Ikshváku's son, and ceased:</l>
<l>The giants from their bonds released</l>
<l>Lauded the King with glad accord,</l>

<l>Before the tyrant side by side</l>
<l>Śuka and Sáraṇ stood and cried:</l>

<l>There in one spot our eyes beheld</l>
<l>Four chiefs on earth unparalleled,</l>
<l>Who with the guardian Gods may vie</l>
<l>Who rule the regions of the sky.</l>
<l>There Ráma stood, the boast and pride</l>
<l>Of Raghu's race, by Lakshmaṇ's side.</l>
<l>There stood the sage Vibhishaṇ, there</l>
<l>Sugríva strong beyond compare.</l>
<l>These four alone can batter down</l>
<l>Gate, rampart, wall, and Lanká's town.</l>
<l>Nay, Ráma matchless in his form,</l>
<l>A single foe, thy town would storm:</l>
<l>So wondrous are his weapons, he</l>
<l>Needs not the succour of the three.</l>
<l>Why speak we of the countless train</l>
<l>That fills the valley, hill and plain,</l>

<head>Canto XXXI. The Magic Head.</head>

<lg>
<l>The tyrant's troubled eye confessed</l>
<l>The secret fear that filled his breast.</l>
<l>With dread of coming woe dismayed</l>
<l>He called his counsellors to aid;</l>
<l>Then sternly silent, deep in thought,</l>
<l>His chamber in the palace sought.</l>
<l>Then, as the surest hope of all,</l>
<l>The monarch bade his servants call</l>
<pb n="451"/><anchor id="Pg451"/>
<l>Vidyujjihva, whom magic skill</l>
<l>Made master of the means of ill.</l>
<l>Then spake the lord of Lanká's isle:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Come, Sítá with thine arts beguile.</q></l>
<l>With magic skill and deftest care</l>
<l>A head like Ráma's own prepare.</l>
<l>This head, long shafts and mighty bow,</l>
<l><q rend="post">To Janak's daughter will we show.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: Vidyujjihva obeyed,</l>
<l>And wondrous magic skill displayed;</l>
<l>And Rávaṇ for the art he showed</l>
<l>An ornament of price bestowed.</l>
<l>Then to the grove where Sítá lay</l>
<l>The lord of Lanká took his way.</l>
<l>Pale, wasted, weeping, on the ground</l>
<l>The melancholy queen he found,</l>
<l>Whose thoughts in utmost stress of ill</l>
<l>Were fixed upon her husband still.</l>
<l>The giant king approached the dame,</l>
<l>Declared in tones of joy his name;</l>
<l>Then heeding naught her wild distress</l>
<l>Bespake her, stern and pitiless:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The prince to whom thy fancies cling</q></l>
<l>Though loved and wooed by Lanká's king,</l>
<l>Who slew the noble Khara,—he</l>
<l>Is slain by warriors sent by me.</l>
<l>Thy living root is hewn away,</l>
<l>Thy scornful pride is tamed to-day.</l>
<l>Thy lord in battle's front has died,</l>
<l>And Sítá shall be Rávaṇ's bride.</l>
<l>Hence, idle thoughts: thy hope is fled;</l>
<l>What wilt thou, Sítá, with the dead?</l>
<l>Rise, child of Janak, rise and be</l>
<l>The queen of all my queens and me.</l>
<l>Incline thine ear, and I will tell,</l>
<l>Dear lady, how thy husband fell.</l>
<l>He bridged his way across the sea</l>
<l>With countless troops to fight with me.</l>
<l>The setting sun had flushed the west</l>
<l>When on the shore they took their rest.</l>
<l>Weary with toil no watch they kept,</l>
<l>Securely on the sands they slept.</l>
<l>Prahasta's troops assailed our foes,</l>
<l>And smote them in their deep repose.</l>
<l>Scarce could their bravest prove their might:</l>
<l>They perished in the dark of night.</l>
<l>Axe, spear, and sword, directed well,</l>
<l>Upon the sleeping myriads fell.</l>
<l>First in the fight Prahasta's sword</l>
<l>Reft of his head thy slumbering lord.</l>
<l>Roused at the din Vibhishaṇ rose,</l>
<l>The captive of surrounding foes,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ through the woods that spread</l>
<l>Around him with his Vánars fled.</l>
<l>Hanúmán fell: one deadly stroke</l>
<l>The neck of King Sugríva broke,</l>
<l>And Mainda sank, and Dwivid lay</l>
<l>Gasping in blood his life away.</l>
<l>The Vánars died, or fled dispersed</l>
<l>Like cloudlets when the storm has burst.</l>
<l>Some rose aloft in air, and more</l>
<l>Ran to the sea and filled the shore.</l>
<l>On shore, in woods, on hill and plain</l>
<l>Our conquering giants left the slain.</l>
<l>Thus my victorious host o'erthrew</l>
<l>The Vánars, and thy husband slew:</l>
<l>See, rudely stained with dust, and red</l>
<l><q rend="post">With dropping blood, the severed head.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, turning to a Rákshas slave,</l>
<l>The ruthless king his mandate gave,</l>
<l>And straight Vidyujjihva who bore</l>
<l>The head still wet with dripping gore,</l>
<l>The arrows and the mighty bow,</l>
<l>Bent down before his master low.</l>
<l><q>Vidyujjihva,</q> cried Rávaṇ, <q rend="pre">place</q></l>

<l>With fame of this by Ráma strung</l>
<l>The earth and heaven and hell have rung.</l>

<l>Again her eyes with tears o'erflowed:</l>
<l>She gazed upon the head he showed,</l>
<l>Gazed on the bow so famed of yore,</l>
<l>The glorious bow which Ráma bore.</l>
<l>She gazed upon his cheek and brows,</l>
<l>The eyes of her beloved spouse;</l>
<l>His lips, the lustre of his hair,</l>
<l>The priceless gem that glittered there.</l>
<l>The features of her lord she knew,</l>
<l>And, pierced with anguish at the view,</l>
<l>She lifted up her voice and cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Kaikeyí, art thou satisfied?</q></l>
<l>Now all thy longings are fulfilled;</l>
<l>The joy of Raghu's race is killed,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great trembling seized her frame, and she</l>
<l>Fell like a stricken plantain tree.</l>
<l>As lie the dead she lay; at length</l>
<l>Slowly regaining sense and strength,</l>
<l>On the dear head she fixed her eye</l>
<pb n="452"/><anchor id="Pg452"/>
<l>And cried with very bitter cry:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah, when thy cold dead cheek I view,</q></l>
<l>My hero, I am murdered too.</l>
<l>Then first a faithful woman's eyes</l>
<l>See sorrow, when her husband dies.</l>
<l>When thou, my lord, wast nigh to save,</l>
<l>Some stealthy hand thy death wound gave.</l>
<l>Thou art not dead: rise, hero, rise;</l>
<l>Long life was thine, as spake the wise</l>
<l>Whose words, I ween, are ever true,</l>
<l>For faith lies open to their view.</l>
<l>Ah lord, and shall thy head recline</l>
<l>On earth's cold breast, forsaking mine,</l>
<l>Counting her chill lap dearer far</l>
<l>Than I and my caresses are?</l>
<l>Ah, is it thus these eyes behold</l>
<l>Thy famous bow adorned with gold,</l>
<l>Whereon of yore I loved to bind</l>
<l>Sweet garlands that my hands had twined?</l>
<l>And hast thou sought in heaven a place</l>
<l>Amid the founders of thy race,</l>
<l>Where in the home deserved so well</l>
<l>Thy sires and Daśaratha dwell?</l>
<l>Or dost thou shine a brighter star</l>
<l>In skies where blest immortals are,</l>

<l>Turn to my gaze, O turn thine eye:</l>
<l>Why are thy cold lips silent, why?</l>
<l>When first we met as youth and maid,</l>
<l>When in thy hand my hand was laid,</l>

<l>Through life in duty's path with me.</l>
<l>Remember, faithful still, thy vow,</l>
<l>And take me with thee even now.</l>
<l>Is that broad bosom where I hung,</l>
<l>That neck to which I fondly clung,</l>
<l>Where flowery garlands breathed their scent</l>
<l>By hungry dogs and vultures rent?</l>
<l>Shall no funereal honours grace</l>
<l>The parted lord of Raghu's race,</l>
<l>Whose bounty liberal fees bestowed,</l>
<l>For whom the fires of worship glowed?</l>
<l>Kauśalyá wild with grief will see</l>
<l>One sole survivor of the three</l>
<l>Who in their hermit garments went</l>
<l>To the dark woods in banishment.</l>
<l>Then at her cry shall Lakshmaṇ tell</l>
<l>How, slain by night, the Vánars fell;</l>
<l>How to thy side the giants crept,</l>
<l>And slew the hero as he slept.</l>
<l>Thy fate and mine the queen will know,</l>
<l>And broken-hearted die of woe.</l>
<l>For my unworthy sake, for mine,</l>
<l>Ráma, the glory of his line,</l>
<l>Who bridged his way across the main,</l>
<l>Is basely in a puddle slain;</l>
<l>And I, the graceless wife he wed,</l>
<l>Have brought this ruin on his head.</l>
<l>Me, too, on him, O Rávaṇ, slay:</l>
<l>The wife beside her husband lay.</l>
<l>By his dear body let me rest,</l>
<l>Cheek close to cheek and breast to breast,</l>
<l>My happy eyes I then will close,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus cried the miserable dame;</l>
<l>When to the king a warder came,</l>

<l>The anxious tyrant left his seat</l>

<l>Then, filled with zeal for Sítá's sake,</l>

<l>One moment quailed his haughty look,</l>

<l>And with a voice that thundered through</l>
<l>The council hall began anew:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Lords, I have heard—your tongues have told—</q></l>
<l>How Raghu's son is fierce and bold.</l>
<l>To Lanká's shore has bridged his way</l>

<l>Thus to the monarch's speech replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Long reigns the king in safe repose,</q></l>
<l>Unmoved by fear of vanquished foes,</l>
<l>Whose feet by saving knowledge led</l>

<l>To order peace, to strike or yield:</l>
<l>Prefers, when foes are stronger, peace,</l>
<l>And bids a doubtful conflict cease.</l>
<l>Now, King, the choice before thee lies,</l>
<l>Make peace with Ráma, and be wise.</l>
<l>This day the captive queen restore</l>
<l>Who brings the foe to Lanká's shore.</l>
<l>The Sire by whom the worlds are swayed</l>
<l>Of yore the Gods and demons made.</l>
<l>With these Injustice sided; those</l>

<l>Still Justice dwells with Gods above;</l>
<l>Injustice, fiends and giants love.</l>
<l>Thou, through the worlds that fear thee, long</l>

<l>And Justice, with thy foes allied,</l>
<l>Gives might resistless to their side.</l>
<l>Thou, guided by thy wicked will,</l>
<l>Hast found delight in deeds of ill,</l>

<l>In them the power and glory live</l>
<l>Which zeal and saintly fervour give.</l>
<l>Their constant task, their sole delight</l>
<l>Is worship and each holy rite,</l>
<l>To chant aloud the Veda hymn,</l>
<l>Nor let the sacred fires grow dim.</l>
<l>Now through the air like thunder ring</l>

<l>The vapours of their incense rise</l>

<l>By Brahmá's boon thy life was screened</l>

<lg>
<l>But Rávaṇ's breast with fury swelled,</l>
<l>And thus he spake by Death impelled,</l>
<l>While, under brows in anger bent,</l>
<l>Fierce glances from his eyes were sent:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The bitter words which thou, misled</q></l>
<l>By friendly thought, hast fondly said,</l>
<l>Which praise the foe and counsel fear,</l>
<l>Unheeded fall upon mine ear.</l>
<l>How canst thou deem a mighty foe</l>
<l>This Ráma who, in stress of woe,</l>
<l>Seeks, banished as his sire decreed,</l>
<l>Assistance from the Vánar breed?</l>
<l>Am I so feeble in thine eyes,</l>
<l>Though feared by dwellers of the skies,—</l>
<l>Whose might in many a battle shown</l>
<l>The glorious race of giants own?</l>
<l>Shall I for fear of him restore</l>
<l>The lady whom I hither bore,</l>
<l>Exceeding fair like Beauty's Queen<note place="foot">Lakshmí is the Goddess both of
beauty and fortune, and is represented with a lotus in her hand.</note></l>
<l>Without her well-loved lotus seen?</l>
<l>Around the chief let Lakshmaṇ stand,</l>
<l>Sugríva, and each Vánar band,</l>
<l>Soon, Malyaván, thine eyes will see</l>
<l>This boasted Ráma slain by me.</l>
<l>I in the brunt of war defy</l>
<l>The mightiest warriors of the sky;</l>
<l>And if I stoop to combat men,</l>
<l>Shall I be weak and tremble then?</l>
<l>This mangled trunk the foe may rend,</l>
<l>But Rávaṇ ne'er can yield or bend,</l>
<l>And be it vice or virtue, I</l>
<l>This nature never will belie.</l>
<l>What marvel if he bridged the sea?</l>
<l>Why should this deed disquiet thee?</l>
<l>This, only this, I surely know,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in loud tones the king exclaimed,</l>
<l>And mute stood Malyaván ashamed,</l>
<l>His reverend head he humbly bent,</l>
<l>And slowly to his mansion went.</l>
<l>But Rávaṇ stayed, and deep in care</l>
<l>Held counsel with his nobles there,</l>
<l>All entrance to secure and close,</l>
<l>And guard the city from their foes.</l>
<l>He bade the chief Prahasta wait,</l>

<l>Before the wondering Vánars, gay</l>
<l>With grove and garden, Lanká lay,</l>
<l>Where golden buds the Champak showed,</l>
<l>And bright with bloom Aśoka glowed,</l>

<l>And built by Viśvakarmá's hand,</l>
<l>He saw the lovely Lanká, dressed</l>
<l>In all her varied beauty, rest.</l>
<l>High on a tower above the gate</l>
<l>The tyrant stood in kingly state.</l>
<l>The royal canopy displayed</l>
<l>Above him lent its grateful shade,</l>
<l>And servants, from the giant band,</l>
<l>His cheek with jewelled chowries fanned.</l>
<l>Red sandal o'er his breast was spread,</l>
<l>His ornaments and robe were red:</l>
<l>Thus shows a cloud of darksome hue</l>
<l>With golden sunbeams flashing through.</l>
<l>While Ráma and the chiefs intent</l>
<l>Upon the king their glances bent,</l>

<l>And reached the turret at a bound.</l>
<l>Unterrified the Vánar stood,</l>
<l>And wroth, with wondrous hardihood,</l>
<l>The king in bitter words addressed,</l>
<l>And thus his scorn and hate expressed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre">King of the giant race, in me</q></l>

<l>While through the air his challenge rang,</l>
<l>At Rávaṇ's face the Vánar sprang.</l>
<l>Snatched from his head the kingly crown</l>
<l>And dashed it in his fury down.</l>
<l>Straight at his foe the giant flew,</l>
<l>His mighty arms about him threw.</l>
<l>With strength resistless swung him round</l>
<l>And dashed him panting to the ground.</l>
<l>Unharmed amid the storm of blows</l>
<l>Swift to his feet Sugríva rose.</l>
<l>Again in furious fight they met:</l>
<l>With streams of blood their limbs were wet,</l>
<l>Each grasping his opponent's waist.</l>
<l>Thus with their branches interlaced,</l>
<l>Which, crimson with the flowers of spring,</l>
<l>From side to side the breezes swing,</l>
<l>In furious wrestle you may see</l>
<l>The Kinśuk and the Seemal tree.<note place="foot">The Kinśuk, also called Paláśa, is
Butea Frondosa, a tree that bears beautiful red crescent shaped blossoms
and is deservedly a favorite with poets. The Seemal or Śálmalí is the silk cotton

<l>They fought with fists and hands, alike</l>
<l>Prepared to parry and to strike.</l>
<l>Long time the doubtful combat, waged</l>
<l>With matchless strength and fury, raged.</l>
<l>Each fiercely struck, each guarded well,</l>
<l>Till, closing, from the tower they fell,</l>
<l>And, grasping each the other's throat,</l>
<l>Lay for an instant in the moat.</l>
<l>They rose, and each in fiercer mood</l>
<l>The sanguinary strife renewed.</l>
<l>Well matched in size and strength and skill</l>
<l>They fought the dubious battle still.</l>
<l>While sweat and blood their limbs bedewed</l>
<l>They met, retreated, and pursued:</l>
<l>Each stratagem and art they tried,</l>
<l>Stood front to front and swerved aside.</l>
<l>His hand a while the giant stayed</l>
<l>And called his magic to his aid.</l>
<l>But brave Sugríva, swift to know</l>
<l>The guileful purpose of the foe,</l>
<l>Gained with light leap the upper air,</l>
<l>And breath and strength and spirit there;</l>

<l>The Vánar host in serried ranks</l>
<l>Press to the moat and line the banks,</l>
<l>And, first in splendour and in place,</l>
<l>The lion lord of Raghu's race.</l>
<l>And Ráma looked on Lanká where</l>
<l>Gay flags were streaming to the air,</l>
<l>And, while keen sorrow pierced him through,</l>
<l>His loving thoughts to Sítá flew:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">There, there in deep affliction lies</q></l>
<l>My darling with the fawn-like eyes.</l>

<l>Mad with the thought, <q>Charge, charge,</q> he cried.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Responsive to his call rang out</l>
<l>A loud, a universal shout,</l>
<l>As myriads filled the moat with stone,</l>
<l>Trees, rocks, and mountains overthrown,</l>
<l>And charging at their leader's call</l>
<l>Pressed forward furious to the wall.</l>
<l>Some in their headlong ardour scaled</l>
<l>The rampart's height, the guard assailed,</l>
<l>And many a ponderous fragment rent</l>
<l>From portal, tower, and battlement.</l>
<l>Huge gates adorned with burnished gold</l>
<l>Were loosed and lifted from their hold;</l>
<l>And post and pillar, with a sound</l>
<l>Like thunder, fell upon the ground.</l>
<l>At every portal, east and west</l>
<l>And north and south, the chieftains pressed</l>
<l>Each in his post appointed led</l>

<l>And every martial instrument.</l>
<l>Forth, at the bidding of their lord</l>
<l>From every gate the giants poured,</l>
<l>As, when the waters rise and swell,</l>
<l>Huge waves preceding waves impel.</l>
<l>Again from every Vánar throat</l>
<l>A scream of fierce defiance smote</l>
<l>The welkin: earth and sea and sky</l>

<l>The roar of elephants, the neigh</l>

<l>The frequent clash of warriors' steel,</l>

<l>Fierce was the deadly fight: opposed</l>

<l>As when the Gods of heaven enraged</l>
<l>With rebel fiends wild battle waged.</l>
<l>Axe, spear, and mace were wielded well:</l>
<l>At every blow a Vánar fell.</l>
<l>But shivered rock and brandished tree</l>
<l>Brought many a giant on his knee,</l>

<l>Hanúmán, Jambumáli met</l>
<l>In mortal opposition set.</l>
<l>Vibhishaṇ, brother of the lord</l>

<l>And singled out, with eyes aglow</l>
<l>With wrath, Śatrughna for his foe.</l>
<l>The mighty Gaja Tapan sought,</l>

<l>Sugríva, Vánar king, defied</l>

<l>Mitraghana, he who loved to strike</l>
<l>His foeman and his friend alike:</l>

<l>Crushed down the giant with a tree.</l>
<l>Then car-borne Jambumáli smote</l>
<l>Hanumán on the chest and throat;</l>
<l>But at the car the Vánar rushed,</l>
<l>And chariot, steeds, and rider crushed.</l>
<l>Sugríva whirled a huge tree round,</l>

<l>One arrow shot from Lakshmaṇ's bow</l>
<l>Laid mighty Vírúpáksha low.</l>
<l>His giant foes round Ráma pressed</l>

<l>The lord of Light had sunk and set:</l>
<l>Night came; the foeman struggled yet;</l>
<l>And fiercer for the gloom of night</l>
<l>Grew the wild fury of the fight.</l>
<l>Scarce could each warrior's eager eye</l>
<l>The foeman from the friend descry.</l>
<l><q>Rákshas or Vánar? say;</q> cried each,</l>

<l><q rend="pre">Why wilt thou fly? O warrior, stay:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Turn on the foe, and rend and slay:</q></l>
<l>Such were the cries, such words of fear</l>

<l>Each swarthy rover of the night</l>
<l>Whose golden armour flashed with light,</l>
<l>Showed like a towering hill embraced</l>
<l>By burning woods about his waist.</l>
<l>The giants at the Vánars flew,</l>
<l>And ravening ate the foes they slew:</l>
<l>With mortal bite like serpent's fang,</l>
<l>The Vánars at the giants sprang,</l>
<l>And car and steeds and they who bore</l>
<l>The pennons fell bedewed with gore.</l>
<l>No serried band, no firm array</l>
<l>The fury of their charge could stay.</l>
<l>Down went the horse and rider, down</l>
<l>Went giant lords of high renown.</l>
<l>Though midnight's shade was dense and dark,</l>
<l>With skill that swerved not from the mark</l>
<l>Their bows the sons of Raghu drew,</l>
<l>And each keen shaft a chieftain slew.</l>
<l>Uprose the blinding dust from meads</l>
<l>Ploughed by the cars and trampling steeds,</l>
<l>And where the warriors fell the flood</l>
<l>Was dark and terrible with blood.</l>
<l>Six giants<note place="foot">Yajnaśatru, Mahápárśva, Mahodar,
Vajradanshṭra, Śuka, and Sáraṇ.</note> singled Ráma out,</l>
<l>And charged him with a furious shout</l>
<l>Loud as the roaring of the sea</l>
<l>When every wind is raging free.</l>
<l>Six times he shot: six heads were cleft;</l>
<l>Six giants dead on earth were left.</l>
<l>Nor ceased he yet: his bow he strained,</l>
<l>And from the sounding weapon rained</l>
<l>A storm of shafts whose fiery glare</l>
<l>Filled all the region of the air;</l>
<l>And chieftains dropped before his aim</l>
<l>Like moths that perish in the flame.</l>
<l>Earth glistened where the arrows fell,</l>

<l>Gave to ten chieftains, mid the best</l>

<l>Swift rose in air the Vánar band:</l>
<l>Each region of the sky they scanned:</l>
<l>But Rávaṇ's son by magic skill</l>
<l>Checked them with arrows swifter still,</l>
<l>When streams of blood from chest and side</l>
<l>The dauntless Vánars' limbs had dyed,</l>
<l>The giant in his misty shroud</l>
<l>Showed like the sun obscured by cloud.</l>
<l>Like serpents hissing through the air,</l>
<l>His arrows smote the princely pair;</l>
<l>And from their limbs at every rent</l>
<l>A stream of rushing blood was sent.</l>
<l>Like Kinśuk trees they stood, that show</l>
<l>In spring their blossoms' crimson glow.</l>
<l>Then Indrajít with fury eyed</l>
<l>Ikshváku's royal sons, and cried:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and shouted. Then anew</l>

<l>Their strength relaxed, their eyes grew dim.</l>
<l>As two tall standards side by side,</l>

<l>Fall levelled by the howling blast,</l>
<l>So earth's majestic lords at last</l>

<l>The Vánar chiefs whose piercing eyes</l>
<l>Scanned eagerly the earth and skies,</l>
<l>Saw the brave brothers wounded sore</l>
<l>Transfixed with darts and stained with gore.</l>
<l>The monarch of the Vánar race,</l>
<l>With wise Vibhishaṇ, reached the place;</l>
<l>Angad and Níla came behind,</l>
<l>And others of the forest kind,</l>
<l>And standing with Hanúmán there</l>

<l>The son of Rávaṇ stood confessed.</l>
<l>Fierce Indrajít with savage pride</l>
<l>The fallen sons of Raghu eyed,</l>
<l>And every giant heart was proud</l>
<l>As thus the warrior cried aloud:</l>

<l>The Gods and fiends may toil in vain</l>
<l>To free them from the binding chain.</l>
<l>The haughty chief, my father's dread,</l>
<l>Who drove him sleepless from his bed,</l>
<l>While Lanká, troubled like a brook</l>
<l>In rain time, heard his name and shook:</l>
<l>He whose fierce hate our lives pursued</l>
<l>Lies helpless by my shafts subdued.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still motionless, as lie the slain,</l>
<l>The brothers pressed the bloody plain,</l>
<l>No sigh they drew, no breath they heaved,</l>

<l>Proud of the deed his art had done,</l>
<l>To Lanká's town went Rávaṇ's son,</l>

<l>Each Vánar chief stood sentinel.</l>
<l>At length the mighty hero broke</l>
<l>The trance that held him, and awoke.</l>
<l>He saw his senseless brother, dyed</l>
<l>With blood from head to foot, and cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">What have I now to do with life</q></l>
<l>Or rescue of my prisoned wife,</l>
<l>When thus before my weeping eyes,</l>

<l>Among the best of womankind,</l>
<l>But never such a brother, tried</l>
<l>In war, my guardian, friend, and guide.</l>
<l>If he be dead, the brave and true,</l>
<l>I will not live but perish too.</l>
<l>How, reft of Lakshmaṇ, shall I meet</l>
<l>My mother, and Kaikeyí greet?</l>
<l>My brother's eager question brook,</l>

<l>How, when she hears her son is dead,</l>
<l>Will her sad heart be comforted?</l>
<l>Ah me, for longer life unfit</l>

<l>So sinks to rest, his journey done,</l>
<l>Mid arrowy rays the crimson sun.</l>
<l>Thou, when from home and sire I fled,</l>

<l>And with his mace upraised on high</l>
<l>He wounded Angad on the thigh.</l>
<l>Then from his hand his mace he threw,</l>
<l>And closer to his foeman drew.</l>
<l>Then with their fists they fought, and smote</l>
<l>On brow and cheek and chest and throat.</l>
<l>Worn out with toil, their limbs bedewed,</l>
<l>With blood, the strife they still renewed,</l>
<l>Like Mercury and fiery Mars</l>
<l>Met in fierce battle mid the stars.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A while the deadly fight was stayed:</l>
<l>Each armed him with his trusty blade</l>
<l>Whose sheath with tinkling bells supplied,</l>
<l>And golden net, adorned his side;</l>
<l>And grasped his ponderous leather shield</l>
<l>To fight till one should fall or yield.</l>
<l>Unnumbered wounds they gave and took:</l>
<l>Their wearied bodies reeled and shook.</l>
<l>At length upon the sand that drank</l>
<l>Streams of their blood the warriors sank,</l>
<l>But as a serpent rears his head</l>
<l>Sore wounded by a peasant's tread,</l>
<l>So Angad, fallen on his knees,</l>
<l>Yet gathered strength his sword to seize;</l>
<l>And, severed by the glittering blade,</l>
<l>The giant's head on earth was laid.</l>

[I omit Cantos LV, LVI, LVII, and LVIII, which relate how Akampan and
Prahasta sally out and fall. There is little novelty of incident in these Cantos and
the results are exactly the same as before. In Canto LV, Akampan, at the command
of Rávaṇ, leads forth his troops. Evil omens are seen and heard. The enemies
meet, and many fall on each side, the Vánars transfixed with arrows, the
Rákshases crushed with rocks and trees.
</p>

<p>
In Canto LVI Akampan sees that the Rákshases are worsted, and fights with
redoubled rage and vigour. The Vánars fall fast under his <q>nets of arrows.</q>
Hanumán comes to the rescue. He throws mountain peaks at the giant which are
dexterously stopped with flights of arrows; and at last beats him down and kills him
with a tree.
</p>

<p>
In Canto LVII, Rávaṇ is seriously alarmed. He declares that he himself,
Kumbhakarṇa or Prahasta, must go forth. Prahasta sallies out vaunting that the
fowls of the air shall eat their fill of Vánar flesh.
</p>

<p>
In Canto LVIII, the two armies meet. Dire is the conflict; ceaseless is the rain
of stones and arrows. At last Níla meets Prahasta and breaks his bow. Prahasta
leaps from his car, and the giant and the Vánar fight on foot. Níla with a huge
tree crushes his opponent who falls like a tree when its roots are cut.]

<l>They told him that the chief was killed,</l>

<l>He spoke, and, firm by Lakshmaṇ's side,</l>

<l>The lord of Lanká bade his train</l>
<l>Of warriors by the gates remain,</l>
<l>To guard the city from surprise</l>
<l>By Ráma's forest born allies.</l>
<l>Then as some monster of the sea</l>

<l>Sugríva ran, the king to meet:</l>
<l>A hill uprooted from its seat</l>
<l>He hurled, with trees that graced the height</l>
<l>Against the rover of the night:</l>
<l>But cleft with shafts that checked its way</l>
<l>Harmless upon the earth it lay.</l>
<l>Then fiercer Rávaṇ's fury grew,</l>
<l>An arrow from his side he drew,</l>
<l>Swift as a thunderbolt, aglow</l>
<l>With fire, and launched it at the foe.</l>
<l>Through flesh and bone a way it found,</l>
<l>And stretched Sugríva on the ground.</l>
<l>Susheṇ and Nala saw him fall,</l>
<l>Gaváksha, Gavaya heard their call,</l>
<l>And, poising hills, in act to fling</l>
<l>They charged amain the giant king.</l>
<l>They charged, they hurled the hills in vain,</l>
<l>He checked them with his arrowy rain,</l>
<l>And every brave assailant felt</l>
<l>The piercing wounds his missiles dealt,</l>
<l>Then smitten by the shafts that came</l>
<l>Keen, fleet, and thick, with certain aim,</l>
<l>They fled to Ráma, sure defence</l>
<l>Against the oppressor's violence,</l>
<l>Then, reverent palm to palm applied,</l>
<l>Thus Lakshmaṇ to his brother cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">To me, my lord, the task entrust</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">To lay this giant in the dust.</q></l>
<l><q>Go, then,</q> said Ráma, <q rend="pre">bravely fight;</q></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Lakshmaṇ round his brother threw</l>

<l>Hanúmán from afar beheld</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With heavy hand the giant smote</l>
<l>Hanúmán on the chest and throat,</l>
<l>Who reeled and staggered to and fro,</l>
<l>Stunned for a moment by the blow.</l>
<l>Till, mustering strength, his hand he reared</l>
<l>And struck the foe whom Indra feared.</l>
<l>His huge limbs bent beneath the shock,</l>
<l>As mountains, in an earthquake, rock,</l>
<l>And from the Gods and sages pealed</l>
<l>Shouts of loud triumph as he reeled.</l>
<l>But strength returning nerved his frame:</l>
<l>His eyeballs flashed with fiercer flame.</l>
<l>No living creature might resist</l>
<l>That blow of his tremendous fist</l>
<l>Which fell upon Hanúmán's flank:</l>
<l>And to the ground the Vánar sank,</l>
<l>No sign of life his body showed:</l>
<l>And Rávaṇ in his chariot rode</l>
<l>At Níla; and his arrowy rain</l>
<l>Fell on the captain and his train.</l>
<l>Fierce Níla stayed his Vánar band,</l>
<l>And, heaving with his single hand</l>
<l>A mountain peak, with vigorous swing</l>
<l>Hurled the huge missile at the king.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hanúmán life and strength regained,</l>
<l>Burned for the fight and thus complained:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Why, coward giant, didst thou flee</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">And leave the doubtful fight with me?</q></l>
<l>Seven mighty arrows keen and fleet</l>
<l>The giant launched, the hill to meet;</l>
<l>And, all its force and fury stayed,</l>
<l>The harmless mass on earth was laid.</l>
<l>Enraged the Vánar chief beheld</l>
<l>The mountain peak by force repelled,</l>
<l>And rained upon the foe a shower</l>
<l>Of trees uptorn with branch and flower.</l>
<l>Still his keen shafts which pierced and rent</l>
<l>Each flying tree the giant sent:</l>
<l>Still was the Vánar doomed to feel</l>
<l>The tempest of the winged steel.</l>
<l>Then, smarting from that arrowy storm,</l>
<l>The Vánar chief condensed his form,<note place="foot">Níla was the son of Agni the
God of Fire, and possessed, like Milton's demons, the power of dilating and condensing
his form at pleasure.</note></l>
<l>And lightly leaping from the ground</l>
<l>On Rávaṇ's standard footing found;</l>
<l>Then springing unimpeded down</l>
<l>Stood on his bow and golden crown.</l>
<l>The Vánar's nimble leaps amazed</l>
<l>Ikshváku's son who stood and gazed.</l>
<l>The giant, raging in his heart,</l>
<l>Laid on his bow a fiery dart;</l>
<l>The Vánar on his flagstaff eyed,</l>
<l>And thus in tones of fury cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Well skilled in magic lore art thou:</q></l>
<l>But will thine art avail thee now?</l>
<l>See if thy magic will defend</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thy life against the dart I send.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Rávaṇ spake, the giant king,</l>
<l>And loosed the arrow from the string.</l>
<l>It pierced, with direst fury sped,</l>
<l>The Vánar with its flaming head.</l>
<l>His father's might, his power innate</l>
<l>Preserved him from the threatened fate.</l>
<l>Upon his knees he fell, distained</l>
<l>With streams of blood, but life remained.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still Rávaṇ for the battle burned:</l>
<l>At Lakshmaṇ next his car he turned,</l>
<l>And charged amain with furious show,</l>
<l>Straining in mighty hands his bow.</l>
<l><q>Come,</q> Lakshmaṇ cried, <q rend="pre">assay the fight:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Leave foes unworthy of thy might.</q></l>
<l>Thus Lakshmaṇ spoke: and Lanká's lord</l>
<l>Heard the dread thunder of the cord.</l>
<l>And mad with burning rage and pride</l>
<l>In hasty words like these replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Joy, joy is mine, O Raghu's son:</q></l>
<l>Thy fate to-day thou canst not shun.</l>
<l>Slain by mine arrows thou shalt tread</l>
<l><q rend="post">The gloomy pathway of the dead.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus as he spoke his bow he drew,</l>
<l>And seven keen shafts at Lakshmaṇ flew,</l>
<l>But Raghu's son with surest aim</l>
<l>Cleft every arrow as it came.</l>
<l>Thus with fleet shafts each warrior shot</l>
<l>Against his foe, and rested not.</l>
<l>Then one choice weapon from his store,</l>
<l>By Brahmá's self bestowed of yore,</l>
<l>Fierce as the flames that end the world,</l>
<l>The giant king at Lakshmaṇ hurled.</l>
<l>The hero fell, and racked with pain,</l>
<l>Scarce could his hand his bow retain.</l>
<l>But sense and strength resumed their seat</l>
<l>And, lightly springing to his feet,</l>
<l>He struck with one tremendous stroke</l>
<l>And Rávaṇ's bow in splinters broke.</l>
<l>From Lakshmaṇ's cord three arrows flew</l>
<l>And pierced the giant monarch through.</l>
<l>Sore wounded Rávaṇ closed, and round</l>
<l>Ikshváku's son his strong arms wound.</l>
<l>With strength unrivalled, Brahmá's gift,</l>
<l>He strove from earth his foe to lift.</l>
<l><q>Shall I,</q> he cried, <q rend="pre">who overthrow</q></l>

<l><q rend="post">Be foiled by one of Ráma's kin?</q></l>
<l>But though he heaved, and toiled, and strained,</l>
<l>Unmoved Ikshváku's son remained.</l>
<l>His frame by those huge arms compressed</l>
<l>The giant's God-given force confessed,</l>
<l>But conscious that himself was part</l>
<pb n="470"/><anchor id="Pg470"/>
<l>Of Vishṇu, he was firm in heart.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Wind-God's son the fight beheld,</l>
<l>And rushed at Rávaṇ, rage-impelled.</l>
<l>Down crashed his mighty hand; the foe</l>
<l>Full in the chest received the blow.</l>
<l>His eyes grew dim, his knees gave way,</l>
<l>And senseless on the earth he lay.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Wind-God's son to Ráma bore</l>
<l>Deep-wounded Lakshmaṇ stained with gore.</l>
<l>He whom no foe might lift or bend</l>
<l>Was light as air to such a friend.</l>
<l>The dart that Lakshmaṇ's side had cleft,</l>
<l>Untouched, the hero's body left,</l>
<l>And flashing through the air afar</l>
<l>Resumed its place in Rávaṇ's car;</l>
<l>And, waxing well though wounded sore,</l>
<l>He felt the deadly pain no more.</l>
<l>And Rávaṇ, though with deep wounds pained,</l>
<l>Slowly his sense and strength regained,</l>
<l>And furious still and undismayed</l>
<l>On bow and shaft his hand he laid.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Hanumán to Ráma cried:</l>

<l>Like Vishṇu borne on Garuḍ's wing,</l>

<l>So, burning for the dire attack,</l>
<l>Rode Ráma on the Vánar's back,</l>
<l>And with fierce accents loud and slow</l>
<l>Thus gave defiance to the foe,</l>
<l>While his strained bowstring made a sound</l>
<l>Like thunder when it shakes the ground:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Stay, Monarch of the giants, stay,</q></l>
<l>The penalty of sin to pay.</l>
<l>Stay! whither wilt thou fly, and how</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No word the giant king returned:</l>
<l>His eyes with flames of fury burned.</l>
<l>His arm was stretched, his bow was bent,</l>
<l>And swift his fiery shafts were sent.</l>
<l>Red torrents from the Vánar flowed:</l>
<l>Then Ráma near to Rávaṇ strode,</l>
<l>And with keen darts that never failed,</l>
<l>The chariot of the king assailed.</l>
<l>With surest aim his arrows flew:</l>
<l>The driver and the steeds he slew.</l>
<l>And shattered with the pointed steel</l>
<l>Car, flag, and pole and yoke and wheel.</l>
<l>As Indra hurls his bolt to smite</l>

<l>So Ráma with a flaming dart</l>
<l>Struck Lanká's monarch near the heart,</l>
<l>Who reeled and fell beneath the blow</l>
<l>And from loose fingers dropped his bow.</l>
<l>Bright as the sun, with crescent head,</l>
<l>From Ráma's bow an arrow sped,</l>
<l>And from his forehead, proud no more,</l>
<l>Cleft the bright coronet he wore.</l>
<l>Then Ráma stood by Rávaṇ's side</l>

<l>Then on his breast they rained their blows,</l>
<l>And high the wild commotion rose</l>
<l>When cymbal vied with drum and horn.</l>
<l>And war cries on the gale upborne.</l>
<l>Through all the air loud discord spread,</l>
<l>And, struck with fear, the birds fell dead.</l>
<l>But still he slept and took his rest.</l>
<l>Then dashed they on his shaggy chest</l>
<l>Clubs, maces, fragments of the rock:</l>
<l>He moved not once, nor felt the shock.</l>
<l>The giants made one effort more</l>
<l>With shell and drum and shout and roar.</l>
<l>Club, mallet, mace, in fury plied,</l>
<l>Rained blows upon his breast and side.</l>
<l>And elephants were urged to aid,</l>
<l>And camels groaned and horses neighed.</l>
<l>They drenched him with a hundred pails,</l>
<l>They tore his ears with teeth and nails.</l>
<l>They bound together many a mace</l>
<l>And beat him on the head and face;</l>
<l>And elephants with ponderous tread</l>
<l>Stamped on his limbs and chest and head.</l>
<l>The unusual weight his slumber broke:</l>
<l>He started, shook his sides, and woke;</l>
<l>And, heedless of the wounds and blows,</l>
<l>Yawning with thirst and hunger rose,</l>
<l>His jaws like hell gaped fierce and wide,</l>
<l>Dire as the flame neath ocean's tide.</l>
<l>Red as the sun on Meru's crest</l>
<l>The giant's face his wrath expressed,</l>
<l>And every burning breath he drew</l>
<l>Was like the blast that rushes through</l>
<l>The mountain cedars. Up he raised</l>
<l>His awful head with eyes that blazed</l>
<l>Like comets, dire as Death in form</l>
<l>Who threats the worlds with fire and storm.</l>
<l>The giants pointed to their stores</l>
<l>Of buffaloes and deer and boars,</l>
<l>And straight he gorged him with a flood</l>
<l>Of wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.</l>
<l>He ceased: the giants ventured near</l>
<l>And bent their lowly heads in fear.</l>
<l>Then Kumbhakar[n.]a glared with eyes</l>

<l>Still drowsy from his troubled rest,</l>

<lg>
<l>The son of Raghu near the wall</l>
<l>Saw, proudly towering over all,</l>
<l>The mighty giant stride along</l>
<l>Attended by the warrior throng;</l>
<l>Heard Kumbhakarṇa's heavy feet</l>
<l>Awake the echoes of the street;</l>
<l>And, with the lust of battle fired,</l>
<l>Turned to Vibhishaṇ and inquired:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Vibhishaṇ, tell that chieftain's name</q></l>

<l>Viśravas' son, the Immortals' foe,</l>
<l>Fierce Kumbhakarṇa, mightier far</l>
<l>Than Gods and fiends and giants are.</l>
<l>He conquered Yáma in the fight,</l>
<l>And Indra trembling owned his might.</l>
<l>His arm the Gods and fiends subdued,</l>
<l>Gandharvas and the serpent brood.</l>
<l>The rest of his gigantic race</l>
<l>Are wondrous strong by God-giving grace;</l>
<l>But nature at his birth to him</l>
<l>Gave matchless power and strength of limb.</l>
<l>Scarce was he born, fierce monster, when</l>
<l>He killed and ate a thousand men.</l>
<l>The trembling race of men, appalled,</l>
<l>On Indra for protection called;</l>
<l>And he, to save the suffering world,</l>
<l>His bolt at Kumbhakarṇa hurled.</l>
<l>So awful was the monster's yell</l>
<l>That fear on all the nations fell,</l>
<l>He, rushing on with furious roar,</l>
<l>A tusk from huge Airávat tore,</l>
<l>And dealt the God so dire a blow</l>
<l>That Indra reeling left his foe,</l>
<l>And with the Gods and mortals fled</l>
<l>To Brahmá's throne dispirited.</l>
<l><q>O Brahmá,</q> thus the suppliants cried,</l>

<l>If thus his maw the giant sate</l>
<l><q rend="post">Soon will the world be desolate.</q></l>
<l>The Self-existent calmed their woe,</l>
<l>And spake in anger to their foe:</l>

<l><q rend="post">Such is the curse I lay on thee.</q></l>
<l>Senseless he lay, nor spoke nor stirred;</l>
<l>Such was the power of Brahmá's word.</l>
<l>But Rávaṇ, troubled for his sake,</l>
<l>Thus to the Self-existent spake:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Who lops the tree his care has reared</q></l>
<l>When golden fruit has first appeared?</l>
<l>Not thus, O Brahmá, deal with one</l>
<l>Descended from thine own dear son.<note place="foot">Pulastya was the son of Brahmá
and father of Viśravas or Paulastya the father of Rávaṇ and Kumbhakarṇa.</note></l>
<l>Still thou, O Lord, thy word must keep,</l>
<l>He may not die, but let him sleep.</l>
<l>Yet fix a time for him to break</l>
<l><q rend="post">The chains of slumber and awake.</q></l>
<l>He ceased: and Brahmá made reply;</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Six months in slumber shall he lie</q></l>
<l>And then arising for a day</l>
<l><q rend="post">Shall cast the numbing bonds away.</q></l>
<l>Now Rávaṇ in his doubt and dread</l>
<l>Has roused the monster from his bed,</l>
<l>Who comes in this the hour of need</l>
<l>On slaughtered Vánars flesh to feed.</l>
<l>Each Vánar, when his awe-struck eyes</l>
<l>Behold the monstrous chieftain, flies.</l>
<l>With hopeful words their minds deceive,</l>

<l>Along bright Lanká's royal road</l>

<head>Canto LXVII. Kumbhakarna's Death.</head>

<lg>
<l>Thus from their flight the Vánars turned,</l>
<l>And every heart for battle burned,</l>
<l>Determined on the spot to die</l>
<l>Or gain a warrior's meed on high.</l>
<l>Again the Vánars stooped to seize</l>
<l>Their weapons, rocks and fallen trees;</l>
<l>Again the deadly fight began,</l>
<l>And fiercely at the giant ran.</l>
<l>Unmoved the monster kept his place:</l>
<l>He raised on high his awful mace,</l>
<l>Whirled the huge weapon round his head</l>
<l>And laid the foremost Vánars dead.</l>
<l>Eight thousand fell bedewed with gore,</l>
<l>Then sank and died seven hundred more.</l>
<l>Then thirty, twenty, ten, or eight</l>
<l>At each fierce onset met their fate,</l>
<l>And fast the fallen were devoured</l>
<l>Like snakes by Garuḍ's beak o'erpowered.</l>
<l>Then Dwivid from the Vánar van,</l>
<l>Armed with an uptorn mountain, ran,</l>
<l>Like a huge cloud when fierce winds blow,</l>
<l>And charged amain the mountain foe.</l>
<l>With wondrous force the hill he threw:</l>
<l>O'er Kumbhakarṇa's head it flew,</l>
<l>And falling on his host afar</l>
<l>Crushed many a giant, steed, and car.</l>
<l>Rocks, trees, by fierce Hanúmán sped,</l>
<l>Rained fast on Kumbhakarṇa's head.</l>
<l>Whose spear each deadlier missile stopped,</l>
<l>And harmless on the plain it dropped.</l>
<pb n="476"/><anchor id="Pg476"/>
<l>Then with his furious eyes aglow</l>
<l>The giant rushed upon the foe,</l>
<l>Where, with a woody hill upheaved,</l>
<l>Hanúmán's might his charge received.</l>
<l>Through his vast frame the giant felt</l>
<l>The angry blow Hanúmán dealt.</l>
<l>He reeled a moment, sore distressed,</l>
<l>Then smote the Vánar on the breast,</l>
<l>As when the War-God's furious stroke</l>
<l>Through Krauncha's hill a passage broke.<note place="foot">Kártikeya the God of War,
and the hero and incarnation Paraśuráma are said to have cut a passage through the
mountain Krauncha, a part of the Himálayan range, in the same way as the immense gorge
that splits the Pyrenees under the towers of Marboré was cloven at one blow of
Roland's sword Durandal.</note></l>
<l>Fierce was the blow, and deep and wide</l>
<l>The rent: with crimson torrents dyed,</l>
<l>Hanúmán, maddened by the pain,</l>
<l>Roared like a cloud that brings the rain,</l>
<l>And from each Rákshas throat rang out</l>
<l>Loud clamour and exultant shout.</l>
<l>Then Níla hurled with mustered might</l>
<l>The fragment of a mountain height;</l>
<l>Nor would the rock the foe have missed,</l>
<l>But Kumbhakarṇa raised his fist</l>
<l>And smote so fiercely that the mass</l>
<l>Fell crushed to powder on the grass.</l>
<l>Five chieftains of the Vánar race<note place="foot">Rishabh, Śarabh, Níla, Gaváksha,
and Gandhamádan.</note></l>
<l>Charged Kumbhakarṇa face to face,</l>
<l>And his huge frame they wildly beat</l>
<l>With rocks and trees and hands and feet.</l>
<l>Round Rishabh first the giant wound</l>
<l>His arms and hurled him to the ground,</l>
<l>Where speechless, senseless, wounded sore,</l>
<l>He lay his face besmeared with gore.</l>
<l>Then Níla with his fist he slew,</l>
<l>And Śarabh with his knee o'erthrew,</l>
<l>Nor could Gaváksha's strength withstand</l>
<l>The force of his terrific hand.</l>
<l>At Gandhamádan's eager call</l>
<l>Rushed thousands to avenge their fall,</l>
<l>Nor ceased those Vánars to assail</l>
<l>With knee and fist and tooth and nail.</l>
<l>Around his foes the giant threw</l>
<l>His mighty arms, and nearer drew</l>
<l>The captives subject to his will:</l>
<l>Then snatched them up and ate his fill.</l>
<l>There was no respite then, no pause:</l>
<l>Fast gaped and closed his hell-like jaws:</l>
<l>Yet, prisoned in that gloomy cave,</l>
<l>Some Vánars still their lives could save:</l>
<l>Some through his nostrils found a way,</l>
<l>Some through his ears resought the day.</l>
<l>Like Indra with his thunder, like</l>
<l>The God of Death in act to strike,</l>
<l>The giant seized his ponderous spear,</l>
<l>And charged the foe in swift career.</l>
<l>Before his might the Vánars fell,</l>
<l>Nor could their hosts his charge repel.</l>
<l>Then trembling, nor ashamed to run,</l>
<l>They turned and fled to Raghu's son.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Báli's warrior son<note place="foot">Angad. The text calls
him the son of the son of him who holds the thunderbolt, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> the
grandson of Indra.</note> beheld</l>
<l>Their flight, his heart with fury swelled.</l>
<l>He rushed, with his terrific shout,</l>
<l>To meet the foe and stay the rout.</l>
<l>He came, he hurled a mountain peak,</l>
<l>And smote the giant on the cheek.</l>
<l>His ponderous spear the giant threw:</l>
<l>Fierce was the cast, the aim was true;</l>
<l>But Angad, trained in war and tried,</l>
<l>Saw ere it came, and leapt aside.</l>
<l>Then with his open hand he smote</l>
<l>The giant on the chest and throat.</l>
<l>That blow the giant scarce sustained;</l>
<l>But sense and strength were soon regained.</l>
<l>With force which nothing might resist</l>
<l>He caught the Vánar by the wrist,</l>
<l>Whirled him, as if in pastime, round,</l>
<l>And dashed him senseless on the ground.</l>
<l>There low on earth his foe lay crushed:</l>
<l>At King Sugríva next he rushed,</l>
<l>Who, waiting for the charge, stood still,</l>
<l>And heaved on high a shattered hill,</l>
<l>He looked on Kumbhakarṇa dyed</l>
<l>With streams of blood, and fiercely cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Great glory has thine arm achieved,</q></l>
<l>And thousands of their lives bereaved.</l>
<l>Now leave a while thy meaner foes,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And brook the hill Sugríva throws.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and hurled the mass he held:</l>
<l>The giant's chest the stroke repelled,</l>
<l>Then on the Vánars fell despair,</l>
<l>And Rákshas clamour filled the air.</l>
<l>The giant raised his arm, and fast</l>

<l>Hanúmán caught it as it flew,</l>
<l>And knapped it on his knee in two.</l>
<l>The giant saw the broken spear:</l>
<l>His clouded eye confessed his fear;</l>
<l>Yet at Sugríva's head he sent</l>
<l>A peak from Lanká's mountain rent.</l>
<pb n="477"/><anchor id="Pg477"/>
<l>The rushing mass no might could stay:</l>
<l>Sugríva fell and senseless lay.</l>
<l>The giant stooped his foe to seize,</l>
<l>And bore him thence, as bears the breeze</l>
<l>A cloud in autumn through the sky.</l>
<l>He heard the sad Immortals sigh,</l>
<l>And shouts of triumph long and loud</l>
<l>Went up from all the Rákshas crowd.</l>
<l>Through Lanká's gate the giant passed</l>
<l>Holding his struggling captive fast,</l>
<l>While from each terrace, house, and tower</l>
<l>Fell on his haughty head a shower</l>
<l>Of fragrant scent and flowery rain,</l>
<l>Blossoms and leaves and scattered grain.<note place="foot">The custom of throwing

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By slow degrees the Vánars' lord</l>
<l>Felt life and sense and strength restored.</l>
<l>He heard the giants' joyful boast:</l>
<l>He thought upon his Vánar host.</l>
<l>His teeth and feet he fiercely plied,</l>
<l>And bit and rent the giant's side,</l>
<l>Who, mad with pain and smeared with gore,</l>
<l>Hurled to the ground the load he bore.</l>
<l>Regardless of a storm of blows</l>
<l>Swift to the sky the Vánar rose,</l>
<l>Then lightly like a flying ball</l>
<l>High overleapt the city wall,</l>
<l>And joyous for deliverance won</l>
<l>Regained the side of Raghu's son.</l>
<l>And Kumbhakarṇa, mad with hate</l>
<l>And fury, sallied from the gate,</l>
<l>The carnage of the foe renewed</l>
<l>And filled his maw with gory food.</l>
<l>Slaying, with headlong frenzy blind,</l>
<l>Both Vánar foes and giant kind.</l>

<l>His heart confessed the warrior's power,</l>
<l>And, bleeding from the ceaseless shower</l>
<l>That smote him on the chest and side,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Straight at the king the giant sped,</l>
<l>And earth was shaken at his tread.</l>
<l>His bow the hero grasped and strained,</l>
<l>And deadly shafts in torrents rained.</l>
<l>As Kumbhakarṇa felt each stroke</l>
<l>From his huge mouth burst fire and smoke;</l>
<l>His hands were loosed in mortal pain</l>
<l>And dropped his weapons on the plain.</l>
<l>Though reft of spear and sword and mace</l>
<l>No terror changed his haughty face.</l>
<l>With heavy hands he rained his blows</l>
<l>And smote to death a thousand foes.</l>
<l>Where'er the furious monster strode</l>
<l>While down his limbs the red blood flowed</l>
<l>Like torrents down a mountain's side,</l>
<l>Vánars and bears and giants died.</l>
<l>High o'er his head a rock he swung,</l>
<l>And the huge mass at Ráma flung.</l>
<l>But Ráma's arrows bright as flame</l>
<l>Shattered the mountain as it came.</l>
<l>Then Raghu's son, his eyes aglow</l>
<l>With burning anger, charged the foe,</l>
<l>And as his bow he strained and tried</l>
<l>With fearful clang the cord replied.</l>
<l>Wroth at the bowstring's threatening clang</l>
<l>To meet his foe the giant sprang.</l>
<l>High towering with enormous frame</l>
<l>Huge as a wood-crowned hill he came.</l>
<l>But Ráma firm and self-possessed</l>
<l>In words like these the foe addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Draw near, O Rákshas lord, draw near,</q></l>
<l>Nor turn thee from the fight in fear.</l>
<l>Thou meetest Ráma face to face,</l>
<l>Destroyer of the giant race.</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: and mad with wrath and pride</l>
<l>The giant champion thus replied:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Come thou to me and thou shalt find</q></l>
<l>A foeman of a different kind.</l>
<l>No Khara, no Virádha,—thou</l>
<l>Hast met a mightier warrior now.</l>

<l>And dread the iron mace I rear</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: and Ráma, undismayed,</l>
<l>Upon his cord those arrows laid</l>
<pb n="478"/><anchor id="Pg478"/>
<l>Which pierced the stately Sál trees through,</l>
<l>And Báli king of Vánars slew.</l>
<l>They flew, they smote, but smote in vain</l>
<l>Those mighty limbs that felt no pain.</l>
<l>Then Ráma sent with surest aim</l>
<l>The dart that bore the Wind-God's name.</l>
<l>The missile from the giant tore</l>
<l>His huge arm and the mace it bore,</l>
<l>Which crushed the Vánars where it fell:</l>
<l>And dire was Kumbhakarṇa's yell.</l>
<l>The giant seized a tree, and then</l>
<l>Rushed madly at the lord of men.</l>
<l>Another dart, Lord Indra's own,</l>
<l>To meet his furious onset thrown,</l>
<l>His left arm from the shoulder lopped,</l>
<l>And like a mountain peak it dropped.</l>
<l>Then from the bow of Ráma sped</l>
<l>Two arrows, each with crescent head;</l>
<l>And, winged with might which naught could stay,</l>
<l>They cut the giant's legs away.</l>
<l>They fell, and awful was the sound</l>
<l>As those vast columns shook the ground;</l>
<l>And sky and sea and hill and cave</l>
<l>In echoing roars their answer gave.</l>
<l>Then from his side the hero drew</l>
<l>A dart that like the tempest flew—</l>
<l>No deadlier shaft has ever flown</l>
<l>Than that which Indra called his own—</l>
<l>Nor could the giant's mail-armed neck</l>
<l>The fury of the missile check.</l>
<l>Through skin and flesh and bone it smote</l>
<l>And rent asunder head and throat.</l>
<l>Down with the sound of thunder rolled</l>
<l>The head adorned with rings of gold,</l>
<l>And crushed to pieces in its fall</l>
<l>A gate, a tower, a massive wall.</l>
<l>Hurled to the sea the body fell:</l>
<l>Terrific was the ocean's swell,</l>
<l>Nor could swift fin and nimble leap</l>
<l>Save the crushed creatures of the deep.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he who plagued in impious pride</l>
<l>The Gods and Bráhmans fought and died.</l>
<l>Glad were the hosts of heaven, and long</l>
<l>The air re-echoed with their song.<note place="foot">I have abridged this long Canto

<l>Now like a mighty hill in size</l>
<l>His mangled trunk extended lies,</l>
<l>And where he fell, a bleeding mass,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Blocks Lanká's gate that none may pass.</q></l>
<l>The monarch heard: his strength gave way;</l>
<l>And fainting on the ground he lay.</l>
<l>Grieved at the giants' mournful tale,</l>
<l>Long, shrill was Atikáya's wail;</l>
<l>And Triśirás in sorrow bowed</l>
<l>His triple head, and wept aloud.</l>
<l>Mahodar, Mahápárśva shed</l>
<l>Hot tears and mourned their brother dead.</l>

<l>And rushed at Angad with a cry.</l>
<l>Behind came Triśirás, and near</l>
<l>Mahodar charged with levelled spear.</l>
<l>There Angad stood to fight with three:</l>
<l>High o'er his head he waved a tree,</l>
<l>And at Devántak, swift and true</l>
<l>As Indra's flaming bolt, it flew.</l>
<l>But, cut by giant shafts in twain,</l>
<l>With minished force it flew in vain.</l>
<l>A shower of trees and blocks of stone</l>
<l>From Angad's hand was fiercely thrown;</l>
<l>But well his club Devántak plied</l>
<l>And turned each rock and tree aside.</l>
<l>Nor yet, by three such foes assailed,</l>
<pb n="480"/><anchor id="Pg480"/>
<l>The heart of Angad sank or quailed.</l>
<l>He slew the mighty beast that bore</l>
<l>Mahodar: from his head he tore</l>
<l>A bleeding tusk, and blow on blow</l>
<l>Fell fiercely on his Rákshas foe.</l>
<l>The giant reeled, but strength regained,</l>
<l>And furious strokes on Angad rained,</l>
<l>Who, wounded by the storm of blows,</l>
<l>Sank on his knees, but swiftly rose.</l>
<l>Then Triśirás, as up he sprang,</l>
<l>Drew his great bow with awful clang,</l>
<l>And fixed three arrows from his sheaf</l>
<l>Full in the forehead of the chief.</l>
<l>Hanúmán saw, nor long delayed</l>
<l>To speed with Níla to his aid,</l>
<l>Who at the three-faced giant sent</l>
<l>A peak from Lanká's mountain rent.</l>
<l>But Triśirás with certain aim</l>
<l>Shot rapid arrows as it came:</l>
<l>And shivered by their force it broke</l>
<l>And fell to earth with flash and smoke.</l>
<l>Then as the Wind-God's son came nigh,</l>
<l>Devántak reared his mace on high.</l>
<l>Hanúmán smote him on the head</l>
<l>And stretched the monstrous giant dead.</l>
<l>Fierce Triśirás with fury strained</l>
<l>His bow, and showers of arrows rained</l>
<l>That smote on Níla's side and chest:</l>
<l>He sank a moment, sore distressed;</l>
<l>But quickly gathered strength to seize</l>
<l>A mountain with its crown of trees.</l>
<l>Crushed by the hill, distained with gore,</l>
<l>Mahodar fell to rise no more.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Triśirás raised high his spear</l>
<l>Which chilled the trembling foe with fear</l>
<l>And, like a flashing meteor through</l>
<l>The air at Hanúmán it flew.</l>
<l>The Vánar shunned the threatened stroke,</l>
<l>And with strong hands the weapon broke.</l>
<l>The giant drew his glittering blade:</l>
<l>Dire was the wound the weapon made</l>
<l>Deep in the Vánar's ample chest,</l>
<l>Who, for a moment sore oppressed,</l>
<l>Raised his broad hand, regaining might,</l>
<l>And struck the rover of the night.</l>
<l>Fierce was the blow: with one wild yell</l>
<l>Low on the earth the monster fell.</l>
<l>Hanúmán seized his fallen sword</l>
<l>Which served no more its senseless lord,</l>
<l>And from the monster triple-necked</l>
<l>Smote his huge heads with crowns bedecked.</l>
<l>Then Mahápárśva burned with ire;</l>
<l>Fierce flashed his eyes with vengeful fire.</l>
<l>A moment on the dead he gazed,</l>
<l>Then his black mace aloft was raised,</l>
<l>And down the mass of iron came</l>
<l>That struck and shook the Vánar's frame.</l>
<l>Hanúmán's chest was wellnigh crushed,</l>
<l>And from his mouth red torrents gushed:</l>
<l>Yet served one instant to restore</l>
<l>His spirit: from the foe he tore</l>
<l>His awful mace, and smote, and laid</l>
<l>The giant in the dust dismayed.</l>
<l>Crushed were his jaws and teeth and eyes:</l>
<l>Breathless and still he lay as lies</l>
<l>A summit from a mountain rent</l>
<l>By him who rules the firmament.</l>

<lg>
<l>But Atikáya's wrath grew high</l>
<l>To see his noblest kinsmen die.</l>
<l>He, fiercest of the giant race,</l>
<l>Presuming still on Brahmá's grace;</l>
<l>Proud tamer of the Immortals' pride,</l>
<l>Whose power and might with Indra's vied,</l>
<l>For blood and vengeful carnage burned,</l>
<l>And on the foe his fury turned.</l>
<l>High on a car that flashed and glowed</l>
<l>Bright as a thousand suns he rode.</l>
<l>Around his princely brows was set</l>
<l>A rich bejewelled coronet.</l>
<l>Gold pendants in his ears he wore;</l>
<l>He strained and tried the bow he bore,</l>
<l>And ever, as a shaft he aimed,</l>
<l>His name and royal race proclaimed.</l>
<l>Scarce might the Vánars brook to hear</l>
<l>His clanging bow and voice of fear:</l>
<l>To Raghu's elder son they fled,</l>
<l>Their sure defence in woe and dread.</l>
<l>Then Ráma bent his eyes afar</l>
<l>And saw the giant in his car</l>
<l>Fast following the flying crowd</l>
<l>And roaring like a rainy cloud.</l>
<l>He, with the lust of battle fired,</l>
<l>Turned to Vibhishaṇ and inquired:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma spake. Vibhishaṇ eyed</l>

<l>On him the giant hosts rely,</l>
<l>And fear no ill when he is nigh.</l>

<l>To meet their foes the Vánars sprang.</l>
<l>Armed with tall trees from Lanká's wood,</l>

<l>The giant's arrows, gold-bedecked,</l>
<l>The storm of hurtling missiles checked;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth sprang Sumitrá's noble child,<note

<l>And strained his ready bow, and smiled;</l>
<l>And giants trembled as the clang</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: and stirred by wrath &amp; pride</l>
<l>Sumitrá's noble son replied:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His giant foe no answer made,</l>
<l>But on his string an arrow laid.</l>
<l>He raised his arm, the cord he drew,</l>
<l>At Lakshmaṇ's breast the arrow flew.</l>
<l>Sumitrá's son, his foemen's dread,</l>
<l>Shot a fleet shaft with crescent head,</l>
<l>Which cleft that arrow pointed well,</l>
<l>And harmless to the earth it fell.</l>
<l>A shower of shafts from Lakshmaṇ's bow</l>
<l>Fell fast and furious on the foe</l>
<l>Who quailed not as the missiles smote</l>
<l>With idle force his iron coat.</l>
<l>Then came the friendly Wind-God near,</l>

<l><q rend="post">The weapon known by Brahmá's name.</q></l>

<l>And with a roar like thunder, true</l>
<l>As Indra's flashing bolt, it flew.</l>
<l>The giant poured his shafts like rain</l>
<l>To check its course, but all in vain.</l>
<l>With spear and mace and sword he tried</l>
<l>To turn the fiery dart aside.</l>
<l>Winged with a force which naught could check,</l>
<l>It smote the monster in the neck,</l>

<l>O'er hill and plain and watery waste</l>

<l>Where'er the Vánar legions came</l>
<l>Their way was marked with hostile flame</l>
<l>That spread in fury to devour</l>
<l>Palace and temple, gate and tower.</l>
<l>Down came the walls and porches, down</l>
<l>Came stately piles that graced the town.</l>
<l>In many a house the fire was red,</l>
<l>On sandal wood and aloe fed.</l>
<l>And scorching flames in billows rolled</l>
<l>O'er diamonds and pearls and gold.</l>
<l>On cloth of wool, on silk brocade,</l>
<l>On linen robes their fury preyed.</l>
<l>Wheels, poles and yokes were burned, and all</l>
<l>The coursers' harness in the stall;</l>
<l>And elephants' and chariots' gear,</l>
<l>The sword, the buckler, and the spear.</l>
<l>Scared by the crash of falling beams,</l>
<l>Mid lamentations, groans and screams,</l>
<l>Forth rushed the giants through the flames</l>
<l>And with them dragged bewildered dames,</l>
<l>Each, with o'erwhelming terror wild,</l>
<l>Still clasping to her breast a child.</l>
<l>The swift fire from a cloud of smoke</l>
<l>Through many a gilded lattice broke,</l>
<l>And, melting pearl and coral, rose</l>
<l>O'er balconies and porticoes.</l>
<l>The startled crane and peacock screamed</l>

<l>And fierce unusual glare was thrown</l>
<l>On shrinking wood and heated stone.</l>
<l>From burning stall and stable freed</l>
<l>Rushed frantic elephant and steed,</l>

<l>Fled wildly through the crowded ways.</l>
<l>As earth with fervent heat will glow</l>

<l>From gate to gate, from court to spire</l>
<l>Proud Lanká was one blaze of fire,</l>

<l>Shone bright a hundred leagues away.</l>
<l>Forth, blinded by the heat and flame</l>
<l>Ran countless giants huge of frame;</l>
<l>And, mustering for fierce attack,</l>
<l>The Vánars charged to drive them back,</l>

<l>Then through the gates Nikumbha hied,</l>
<l>And Kumbha by his brother's side,</l>
<l>Sent forth—the bravest and the best—</l>
<l>To battle by the king's behest.</l>
<l>There fought the chiefs in open field,</l>

<l>Sugríva saw: by rage impelled</l>
<l>He crushed the bow which Kumbha held.</l>
<l>About his foe Sugríva wound</l>
<l>His arms, and, heaving from the ground</l>
<l>The giant hurled him o'er the bank;</l>
<l>And deep beneath the sea he sank.</l>
<l>Like mandar hill with furious swell</l>
<l>Up leapt the waters where he fell.</l>
<l>Again he rose: he sprang to land</l>
<l>And raised on high his threatening hand:</l>
<l>Full on Sugríva's chest it came</l>
<l>And shook the Vánar's massy frame,</l>
<l>But on the wounded bone he broke</l>
<l>His wrist—so furious was the stroke.</l>
<l>With force that naught could stay or check,</l>
<l>Sugríva smote him neath the neck.</l>
<l>The fierce blow crashed through flesh and bone</l>
<l>And Kumbha lay in death o'erthrown.</l>
<l>Nikumbha saw his brother die,</l>
<l>And red with fury flashed his eye.</l>
<l>He dashed with mighty sway and swing</l>
<pb n="485"/><anchor id="Pg485"/>
<l>His axe against the Vánar king;</l>
<l>But shattered on that living rock</l>
<l>It split in fragments at the shock.</l>
<l>Sugríva, rising to the blow,</l>
<l>Raised his huge hand and smote his foe.</l>
<l>And in the dust the giant lay</l>
<l>Gasping in blood his soul away.</l>

[I have briefly despatched Kumbha and Nikumbha, each of whom has in the text a
long Canto to himself. When they fall Rávaṇ sends forth Makaráksha or
Crocodile-Eye, the son of Khara who was slain by Ráma in the forest before the
abduction of Sítá. The account of his sallying forth, of his battle with Ráma
and of his death by the fiery dart of that hero occupies two Cantos which I entirely
pass over. Indrajít again comes forth and, rendered invisible by his magic art
slays countless Vánars with his unerring arrows. He retires to the city and returns
bearing in his chariot an effigy of Sítá, the work of magic, weeping and
wailing by his side. He grasps the lovely image by the hair and cuts it down with
his scimitar in the sight of the enraged Hanúmán and all the Vánar host. At
last after much fighting of the usual kind Indrajít's chariot is broken in pieces, his
charioteer is slain, and he himself falls by Lakshmaṇ's hand, to the inexpressible
delight of the high-souled saints, the nymphs of heaven and other celestial
beings.]

[This Canto does not appear in the Bengal recension. It comes in awkwardly
and may I think be considered as an interpolation, but I paraphrase a portion of
it as a relief after so much fighting and carnage, and as an interesting glimpse of
the monotheistic ideas which underlie the Hindu religion. The hymn does not
readily lend itself to metrical translation, and I have not attempted here to give a
faithful rendering of the whole. A literal version of the text and the commentary
given in the Calcutta edition will be found in the Additional Notes.
</p>

<p>
A canto is here omitted. It contains fighting of the ordinary kind between
Ráma and Rávaṇ, and a description of sights and sounds of evil omen foreboding
the destruction of the giant.]

<l>He spoke, and vanished: Ráma raised</l>
<l>His eyes with reverence meet, and praised</l>
<l>The glorious Day-God full in view:</l>
<l>Then armed him for the fight anew.</l>
<l>Urged onward by his charioteer</l>
<l>The giant's foaming steeds came near,</l>
<l>And furious was the battle's din</l>
<l>Where each resolved to die or win.</l>
<l>The Rákshas host and Vánar bands</l>
<l>Stood with their weapons in their hands,</l>
<l>And watched in terror and dismay</l>
<l>The fortune of the awful fray.</l>
<l>The giant chief with rage inflamed</l>
<l>His darts at Ráma's pennon aimed;</l>
<l>But when they touched the chariot made</l>
<l>By heavenly hands their force was stayed.</l>
<l>Then Ráma's breast with fury swelled;</l>
<l>He strained the mighty bow he held,</l>
<l>And straight at Rávaṇ's banner flew</l>
<l>An arrow as the string he drew—</l>
<l>A deadly arrow swift of flight,</l>
<l>Like some huge snake ablaze with light,</l>
<l>Whose fury none might e'er repel,—</l>
<l>And, split in twain, the standard fell.</l>
<l>At Ráma's steeds sharp arrows, hot</l>
<l>With flames of fire, the giant shot.</l>
<l>Unmoved the heavenly steeds sustained</l>
<l>The furious shower the warrior rained,</l>
<l>As though soft lotus tendrils smote</l>

<l>The warriors' steeds together dashed,</l>
<l>And pole with pole reëchoing clashed.</l>
<l>Then Ráma launching dart on dart</l>

<l>Nor was the lord of Lanká slow</l>

<lg>
<l>While thus they wept, supreme in place,</l>
<l>The loveliest for form and face,</l>
<l>Mandodarí drew near alone,</l>
<l>Looked on her lord and made her moan:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Ah Monarch, Indra feared to stand</q></l>
<l>In fight before thy conquering hand.</l>
<l>From thy dread spear the Immortals ran;</l>
<l>And art thou murdered by a man?</l>
<l>Ah, 'twas no child of earth, I know,</l>
<l>That smote thee with that mortal blow.</l>
<l>'Twas Death himself in Ráma's shape,</l>
<l>That slew thee: Death whom none escape.</l>
<l>Or was it he who rules the skies</l>
<l>Who met thee, clothed in man's disguise?</l>
<l>Ah no, my lord, not Indra: he</l>
<l>In battle ne'er could look on thee.</l>
<l>One only God thy match I deem:</l>
<l>'Twas Vishṇu's self, the Lord Supreme,</l>
<l>Whose days through ceaseless time extend</l>
<l>And ne'er began and ne'er shall end:</l>
<l>He with the discus, shell, and mace,</l>
<l>Brought ruin on the giant race.</l>
<l>Girt by the Gods of heaven arrayed</l>
<l>Like Vánar hosts his strength to aid,</l>
<l>He Ráma's shape and arms assumed</l>
<pb n="493"/><anchor id="Pg493"/>
<l>And slew the king whom Fate had doomed.</l>
<l>In Janasthán when Khara died</l>
<l>With giant legions by his side,</l>
<l>No mortal was the unconquered foe</l>
<l>In Ráma's form who struck the blow.</l>
<l>When Hanumán the Vanár came</l>
<l>And burnt thy town with hostile flame,</l>
<l>I counselled peace in anxious fear:</l>
<l>I counselled, but thou wouldst not hear.</l>
<l>Thy fancy for the foreign dame</l>
<l>Has brought thee death and endless shame.</l>
<l>Why should thy foolish fancy roam?</l>
<l>Hadst thou not wives as fair at home?</l>
<l>In beauty, form and grace could she,</l>
<l>Dear lord, surpass or rival me?</l>
<l>Now will the days of Sítá glide</l>
<l>In tranquil joy by Ráma's side:</l>
<l>And I—ah me, around me raves</l>
<l>A sea of woe with whelming waves.</l>
<l>With thee in days of old I trod</l>
<l>Each spot beloved by nymph and God;</l>
<l>I stood with thee in proud delight</l>
<l>On Mandar's side and Meru's height;</l>
<l>With thee, my lord, enchanted strayed</l>
<l>In Chaitraratha's<note place="foot">The garden of Kuvera, the God of

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Ráma to Vibhishaṇ cried:</l>

<l>Down their wan cheeks their sorrow sowed,</l>
<l>Upon a golden litter laid</l>

<l>Then was the golden litter raised,</l>

<l>Came sad the widowed multitude.</l>
<l>Where, raised as Bráhmans ordered, stood</l>
<l>Piled sandal logs, and scented wood,</l>
<l>The body of the king was set</l>
<l>High on a deerskin coverlet.</l>
<l>Then duly to the monarch's shade</l>
<l>The offerings for the dead they paid,</l>
<l>And southward on the eastern side</l>
<l>An altar formed and fire supplied.</l>
<l>Then on the shoulder of the dead</l>
<l>The oil and clotted milk were shed.</l>
<l>All rites were done as rules ordain:</l>
<l>The sacrificial goat was slain.</l>
<l>Next on the corpse were perfumes thrown</l>
<l>And many a flowery wreath was strown;</l>
<l>And with Vibhishaṇ's ready aid</l>
<l>Rich vesture o'er the king was laid.</l>
<l>Then while the tears their cheeks bedewed</l>
<l>Parched grain upon the dead they strewed;</l>
<l>Last, to the wood, as rules require,</l>
<l>Vibhishaṇ set the kindling fire.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then having bathed, as texts ordain,</l>
<l>To Lanká went the mourning train.</l>
<l>Vibhishaṇ, when his task was done,</l>

<l>The Vánar chieftain bowed his head,</l>
<l>Within the walls of Lanká sped,</l>
<l>Leave from the new-made king obtained,</l>
<l>And Sítá's lovely garden gained.</l>
<l>Beneath a tree the queen he found,</l>
<l>Where Rákshas warders watched around.</l>
<l>Her pallid cheek, her tangled hair,</l>
<l>Her raiment showed her deep despair,</l>
<l>Near and more near the envoy came</l>
<l>And gently hailed the weeping dame.</l>
<l>She started up in sweet surprise,</l>
<l>And sudden joy illumed her eyes.</l>
<l>For well the Vánar's voice she knew,</l>
<l>And hope reviving sprang and grew.</l>
</lg>

<l>The warders at Vibhishaṇ's hest</l>
<l>The onward rushing throng repressed,</l>

<l>Thus spoke the Self-existent Sire:</l>
<l>Then swiftly from the blazing pyre</l>
<l>The circling flames were backward rolled,</l>
<l>And, raising in his gentle hold</l>
<l>Alive unharmed the Maithil dame,</l>
<l>The Lord of Fire embodied came.</l>
<l>Fair as the morning was her sheen,</l>
<l>And gold and gems adorned the queen.</l>
<l>Her form in crimson robes arrayed,</l>
<l>Her hair was bound in glossy braid.</l>
<l>Her wreath was fresh and sweet of scent,</l>
<l>Undimmed was every ornament.</l>
<l>Then, standing close to Ráma'a side,</l>
<l>The universal witness cried:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">From every blot and blemish free</q></l>
<l>Thy faithful queen returns to thee.</l>
<l>In word or deed, in look or mind</l>
<l>Her heart from thee has ne'er declined.</l>
<l>By force the giant bore away</l>
<l>From thy lone cot his helpless prey;</l>
<l>And in his bowers securely kept</l>
<l>She still has longed for thee and wept.</l>
<l>With soft temptation, bribe and threat,</l>
<l>He bade the dame her love forget:</l>
<l>But, nobly faithful to her lord,</l>
<l>Her soul the giant's suit abhorred.</l>
<l>Receive, O King, thy queen again,</l>

<l>For else had many a slanderous tongue</l>
<l>Reproaches on mine honour flung,</l>
<l>And scorned the king who, love-impelled,</l>
<l>His consort from the proof withheld.</l>
<l>No doubt had I, but surely knew</l>
<l>That Janak's child was pure and true,</l>
<l>That, come what might, in good and ill</l>
<l>Her faithful heart was with me still.</l>
<l>I knew that Rávaṇ could not wrong</l>
<l>My queen whom virtue made so strong.</l>
<l>I knew his heart would sink and fail,</l>
<l>Nor dare her honour to assail,</l>
<l>As Ocean, when he raves and roars,</l>
<l>Fears to o'erleap his bounding shores.</l>
<l>Now to the worlds her truth is shown,</l>

<l>This order to Śatrughna sent:</l>

<l>Go forth, go forth to meet your king,</l>

<l>Call forth the royal matrons: call</l>

<l>Send Bráhmans and the warrior host,</l>

<l>Attended close by thousands more</l>
<l>Gay with the gear and flags they bore.</l>
<l>A thousand chiefs their steeds bestrode,</l>
<l>Their glittering cars a thousand showed.</l>
<l>And countless hosts in rich array</l>
<l>Pursued on foot their eager way.</l>
<l>Veiled from the air with silken screens</l>
<l>In litters rode the widowed queens.</l>
<l>Kausalyá first, acknowledged head</l>
<l>And sovereign of the household, led:</l>
<l>Sumitrá next, and after, dames</l>
<l>Of lower rank and humbler names.</l>
<l>Then compassed by a white-robed throng</l>
<l>Of Bráhmans, heralded with song,</l>
<l>With shouts of joy from countless throats,</l>
<l>And shells' and tambours' mingled notes,</l>
<l>And drums resounding long and loud,</l>
<l>Exulting Bharat joined the crowd.</l>
<l>Still on his head, well-trained in lore</l>
<l>Of duty, Ráma's shoes he bore.</l>
<l>The moon-white canopy was spread</l>
<l>With flowery twine engarlanded,</l>
<l>And jewelled cheuries, meet to hold</l>
<l>O'er Ráma's brow, shone bright with gold,</l>
<l>Though Nandigráma's town they neared,</l>
<l>Of Ráma yet no sign appeared.</l>

<l>That murmur with the song of bees;</l>
<l>For Ráma's sake the saint has made</l>

<l>Then at Sumitrá's feet he bent,</l>

<l>King Ráma as he homeward rode,</l>
<l>In power and might unparalleled.</l>
<l>The reins the hand of Bharat held.</l>
<l>Above the peerless victor's head</l>
<l>The snow-white shade Śatrughna spread,</l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ's ever-ready hand</l>
<l>His forehead with a chourie fanned.</l>
<l>Vibhishaṇ close to Lakshmaṇ's side</l>
<l>Sharing his task a chourie plied.</l>
<l>Sugríva on Śatrunjay came,</l>
<l>An elephant of hugest frame:</l>
<l>Nine thousand others bore, behind,</l>
<l>The chieftains of the Vánar kind</l>
<l>All gay, in forms of human mould,</l>
<l>With rich attire and gems and gold.</l>
<pb n="505"/><anchor id="Pg505"/>
<l>Thus borne along in royal state</l>
<l>King Ráma reached Ayodbyá's gate</l>
<l>With merry noise of shells and drums</l>
<l>And joyful shouts, He comes, he comes,</l>
<l>A Bráhman host with solemn tread,</l>
<l>And kine the long procession led,</l>
<l>And happy maids in ordered bands</l>
<l>Threw grain and gold with liberal hands.</l>
<l>Neath gorgeous flags that waved in rows</l>
<l>On towers and roofs and porticoes.</l>
<l>Mid merry crowds who sang and cheered</l>
<l>The palace of the king they neared.</l>
<l>Then Raghu's son to Bharat, best</l>
<l>Of duty's slaves, these words addressed:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Pass onward to the monarch's hall.</q></l>
<l>The high-souled Vánars with thee call,</l>
<l>And let the chieftains, as is meet,</l>
<l>The widows of our father greet.</l>
<l>And to the Vánar king assign</l>
<l>Those chambers, best of all, which shine</l>
<l>With lazulite and pearl inlaid,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And pleasant grounds with flowers and shade.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He ceased: and Bharat bent his head;</l>
<l>Sugríva by the hand he led</l>
<l>And passed within the palace where</l>
<l>Stood couches which Śatrughna's care,</l>
<l>With robes and hangings richly dyed,</l>
<l>And burning lamps, had seen supplied.</l>
<l>Then Bharat spake: <q rend="pre">I pray thee, friend,</q></l>
<l>Thy speedy messengers to send,</l>
<l>Each sacred requisite to bring</l>
<l><q rend="post">That we may consecrate our king.</q></l>
<l>Sugríva raised four urns of gold,</l>
<l>The water for the rite to hold,</l>
<l>And bade four swiftest Vánars flee</l>
<l>And fill them from each distant sea.</l>
<l>Then east and west and south and north</l>
<l>The Vánar envoys hastened forth.</l>
<l>Each in swift flight an ocean sought</l>
<l>And back through air his treasure brought,</l>
<l>And full five hundred floods beside</l>
<l>Pure water for the king supplied.</l>
<l>Then girt by many a Bráhman sage,</l>

<l>High on a throne with jewels graced</l>
<l>King Ráma and his Sítá placed.</l>
<l>There by Jábáli, far revered,</l>

<l>By Gautam's side Kátváyan stood,</l>
<l>And Vámadeva wise and good,</l>
<l>Whose holy hands in order shed</l>
<l>The pure sweet drops on Ráma's head.</l>
<l>Then priests and maids and warriors, all</l>
<l>Approaching at Vaśishṭha's call,</l>
<l>With sacred drops bedewed their king,</l>
<l>The centre of a joyous ring,</l>
<l>The guardians of the worlds, on high,</l>
<l>And all the children of the sky</l>
<l>From herbs wherewith their hands were filled</l>
<l>Rare juices on his brow distilled.</l>
<l>His brows were bound with glistering gold</l>
<l>Which Manu's self had worn of old,</l>
<l>Bright with the flash of many a gem</l>
<l>His sire's ancestral diadem.</l>
<l>Śatrughna lent his willing aid</l>
<l>And o'er him held the regal shade:</l>
<l>The monarchs whom his arm had saved</l>
<l>The chouries round his forehead waved.</l>
<l>A golden chain, that flashed and glowed</l>
<l>With gems the God of Wind bestowed:</l>
<l>Mahendra gave a glorious string</l>

<l>The skies with acclamation rang,</l>

<l>On that blest day the joyful plain</l>
<l>Was clothed anew with golden grain.</l>
<l>The trees the witching influence knew,</l>

<l>And Ráma's consecration lent</l>

<l>The monarch, joy of Raghu's line,</l>

<l>A jewelled chain, whose lustre passed</l>
<l>The glory of the sun, he cast</l>

<l>A string of pearls of matchless hue</l>
<l>Which gleams like tender moonlight threw</l>

recension (Gorresio's edition) gives them more concisely as follows: <q>This is the
great first poem blessed and glorious, which gives long life to men and victory to kings,
the poem which Válmíki made. He who listens to this wondrous tale of Ráma
unwearied in action shall be absolved from all his sins. By listening to the deeds of
Ráma he who wishes for sons shall obtain his heart's desire, and to him who longs for
riches shall riches be given. The virgin who asks for a husband shall obtain a
husband suited to her mind, and shall meet again her dear kinsfolk who are far
away. They who hear this poem which Válmíki made shall obtain all their desires
and all their prayers shall be fulfilled.</q></note></l>

<head>Section XIII. Rávan Doomed.</head>

<p>
Afterwards Rishyaśring said again to the King <q>I will perform another
sacrificial act to secure thee a son.</q> Then the son of Vibháṇdak, of subdued
passions, seeking the happiness of the king, proceeded to perform the sacrifice for
the accomplishment of his wishes. Hither were previously collected the gods,
with the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the sages, for the sake of receiving their
respective shares, Brahmá too, the sovereign of the gods, with Stháṇu, and Náráyaṇa,
chief of beings and the four supporters of the universe, and the divine
mothers of all the celestials, met together there. To the Aśvamedha, the great
sacrifice of the magnanimous monarch, came also Indra the glorious one, surrounded
by the Maruts. Rishyaśring then supplicated the gods assembled for
their share of the sacrifice (saying), <q>This devout king Daśaratha, who, through
the desire of offspring, confiding in you, has performed sacred austerities, and
who has offered to you the sacrifice called Aśvamedha, is about to perform
another sacrifice for the sake of obtaining sons: To him thus desirous of offspring
be pleased to grant the blessing: I supplicate you all with joined hands. May
he have four sons, renowned through the universe.</q> The gods replied to the
sage's son supplicating with joined hands, <q>Be it so: thou, O Bráhman, art ever
to be regarded by us, as the king is in a peculiar manner. The lord of men by
this sacrifice shall obtain the great object of his desires.</q> Having thus said, the
gods preceded by Indra, disappeared.
</p>

<p>
They all then having seen that (sacrifice) performed by the great sage
according to the ordinance went to Prajápati the lord of mankind, and with
joined hands addressed Brahmá the giver of blessings, <q>O Brahmá, the Ráksha
Rávaṇa by name, to whom a blessing was awarded by thee, through pride troubleth
all of us the gods, and even the great sages, who perpetually practise sacred
austerities. We, O glorious one, regarding the promise formerly granted by thy
kindness that he should be invulnerable to the gods, the Dánavas and the Yakshas
have born (<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>) all, (his oppression); this lord of Rákshas
therefore distresses the universe; and, inflated by this promise unjustly vexes the
divine sages, the Yakshas, and Gandharvas, the Asuras, and men: where Rávaṇa remains
there the sun loses his force, the winds through fear of him do not blow; the fire ceases
to burn; the rolling ocean, seeing him, ceases to move its waves. Viśravas,
distressed by his power, has abandoned Lanká and fled. O divine one save us from
Rávaṇa, who fills the world with noise and tumult. O giver of desired things, be
pleased to contrive a way for his destruction.</q>
</p>

<p>
Brahmá thus informed by the devas, reflecting, replied, <q>Oh! I have devised
the method for slaying this outrageous tyrant. Upon his requesting, <q>May I
be invulnerable to the divine sages, the Gaundharvas, the Yakshas, the Rákshasas
<pb n="508"/><anchor id="Pg508"/>
and the serpents,</q> I replied <q>Be it so.</q> This Ráksha, through contempt,
said nothing respecting man; therefore this wicked one shall be destroyed by
man.</q> The gods, preceded by Śakra, hearing these words spoken by Brahmá,
were filled with joy.
</p>

<p>
At this time Vishṇu the glorious, the lord of the world, arrayed in yellow,
with hand ornaments of glowing gold, riding on Vinateya, as the sun on a cloud,
arrived with his conch, his discus, and his club in his hand. Being adored by
the excellent celestials, and welcomed by Brahmá, he drew near and stood before
him. All the gods then addressed Vishṇu, <q>O Madhusudana, thou art able
to abolish the distress of the distressed. We intreat thee, be our sanctuary, O
Vishṇu.</q> Vishṇu replied, <q>Say, what shall I do?</q> The celestials hearing these
his words added further. <q>The virtuous, the encourager of excellence, eminent
for truth, the firm observer of his vows, being childless, is performing an Aśvamedha
for the purpose of obtaining offspring. For the sake of the good of the
universe, we intreat thee, O Vishṇu, to become his son. Dividing thyself into
four parts, in the wombs of his three consorts equal to Hari, Śrí, and
Kirti, assume the sonship of king Daśaratha, the lord of Ayodhyá, eminent
in the knowledge of duty, generous and illustrious, as the great sages. Thus
becoming man, O Vishṇu, conquer in battle Rávaṇa, the terror of the universe, who
is invulnerable to the gods. This ignorant Rákshasa Rávaṇa, by the exertion of
his power, afflicts the gods, the Gandharvaa, the Siddhas, and the most excellent
sages; these sages, the Gandharvas, and the Apsaras, sporting in the forest
Nandana have been destroyed by that furious one. We, with the sages, are
come to thee seeking his destruction. The Siddhas, the Gandharvas, and the
Yakshas betake themselves to thee, thou art our only refuge; O Deva, afflicter of
enemies, regard the world of men, and destroy the enemy of the gods.</q>
</p>

<p>
Vishṇu, the sovereign of the gods, the chief of the celestials, adored by all
beings, being thus supplicated, replied to all the assembled gods (standing) before
Brahmá, <q>Abandon fear; peace be with you; for your benefit having killed
Rávaṇa the cruel, destructively active, the cause of fear to the divine sages,
together with all his posterity, his courtiers and counsellors, and his relations,
and friends, protecting the earth, I will remain incarnate among men for the
space of eleven thousand years.</q>
</p>

<p>
Having given this promise to the gods, the divine Vishṇu, ardent in the
work, sought a birth-place among men. Dividing himself into four parts, he
whose eyes resemble the lotus and the pulasa, the lotus petal-eyed, chose for his
father Daśaratha the sovereign of men. The divine sages then with the
Gandharvas, the Rudras, and the (different sorts of) Apsaras, in the most excellent
strains, praised the destroyer of Madhu, (saying) <q>Root up Rávaṇa,
of fervid energy, the devastator, the enemy of Indra swollen with pride.
Destroy him, who causes universal lamentation, the annoyer of the holy ascetics,
terrible, the terror of the devout Tapaswis. Having destroyed Rávaṇa, tremendously
powerful, who causes universal weeping, together with his army and
friends, dismissing all sorrow, return to heaven, the place free from stain and
sin, and protected by the sovereign of the celestial powers.</q>

<p>
Prudens ille, voluminum sacrorum gnarus, responsum quod dederat aliquamdiu
meditatus, mente ad se revocata regem deuno est effatus: Parabo tibi
aliud sacrum, genitale, prolis masculae adipiscendae gratia, cum carminibus in
<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Atharvanis</hi> exordio expressis rite peragendum.
Tum coepit modestus Vibhândaci
filius, regis commodis intentus, parare sacrum, quo eius desiderium expleret.
Iam'antea eo convenerant, ut suam quisque portionem acciperent, Dî cum fidicinum
coelestium choris, Beatique cum Sapientibus; Brachman Superûm regnator,
Sthânus nec non augustus Nârâyanus, Indrasque almus, coram visendus Ventorum
cohorte circumdatus, in magno isto sacrificio equino regis magnanimi.
Ibidem vates ille deos, qui portiones suas accipiendi gratia advenerant, apprecatus,
En inquit, hicce ex Dasarathus filiorum desiderio castimoniis adstrictus, fidei
plenus, vestrum numen adoravit sacrificio equino. Nunc iterum accingit se ad
aliud sacrum peragendum: quamobrem aequum est, ut filios cupienti vos faveatis.
Ille ego, qui manus supplices tendo, vos universos pro eo apprecor: nascantur ei
filii quatuor, faina per triplicem mundum clari. Divi supplicem vatis filium invicem
affari: Fiat quod petis! Tu nobis, virsancte, imprimis es venerandus, nee
minus rex ille; compos fiet voti sui egregii hominum princeps. Ita locuti Dî
Indra duce, ex oculis evanuerunt.
</p>

<p>
Superi vero, legitime in concilio congregati.
<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Brachmanem</hi> mundi creatorem
his verbis compellarunt: Tuo munere auctus, O Brachman! gigas nomine Râvanas,
prae superbia nos omnes vexat, pariterque Sapientes castimoniis gaudentes.
A te propitio olim ex voto ei hoc munus concessum fuit, ut ne a diis, Danuidis,
Geniisve necari posset. Nos, oraculum tuum reveriti, facinora eius qualiacunque
toleramus. At ille gigantum tyrannus ternos mundos gravibus iniuriis vexat
Deos, Sapientes, Genios, Fidicines coelestes, Titanes, mortales denique, exsuperat
ille aegre cohibendus, tuoque munere demens. Non ibi calet sol, neque Ventus
prae timore spirat, nee flagrat ignis, ubi Râvanas versatur. Ipse oceanus, vagis
fluctibus redimitus, isto viso stat immotus; eiectus fuit e sede sua Cuvêrus, huius
robore vexatus. Ergo ingens nobis periculum imminet ab hoc gigante visu horribili;
tuum est, alme Parens! auxilium parare, quo hic deleatur. Ita admonitus
ille a diis universis, paulisper meditatus, Ehem! inquit, hancce inveni rationem
nefarium istum necandi. Petierat is a me, ut a Gandharvis, a Geniis, a Divis,
Danuibus Gigantibusque necari non posset et me annuente voto suo potitus est.
Prae contemptu vero monstrum illud homines non commemoravit: ideo ab homine
est necandus: nullum aliud exstat leti genus, quod ei sit fatale. Postquam
audiverant gratum hunc sermonem <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Brachmanis</hi>
ore prolatum, Dî cum duce
suo Indra summopere gaudio erecti sunt. Eodem temporis momento Vishnus,
istuc accessit, splendore insignis, concham, discum et clavum manibus gestans,
croceo vestitu, mundi dominus, vulturis Vinateii dorso, sicuti sol nimbo, vectus,
armillas ex auro candente gerens, salutatus a Superûm primoribus. Quem laudibus
celebratum reverenter Dî universi compellarunt. Tu animantium afflictorum
es vindex, Madhûs interfector! quamobrem nos afflicti te apprecamur. Sis praesidio
nobis numine tuo inconcusso. Dicite, inquit Vishnus, quid pro vobis facere
<pb n="510"/><anchor id="Pg510"/>
me oporteat. Audito eius sermone, Dî hunc in modum respondent: Rex quidam,
nomine Dasarathus, austeris castimoniis sese castigavit, litavit sacrificio equino,
prolis cupidus et prole carens. Nostro hortatu tu, Vishnus, conditionem natorum
eius subeas: ex tribus eius uxoribus, Pudicitiae, Venustatis et Famae similibus,
nasci, velis, temetipsum quadrifariam dividens. Ibi tu in humanam naturam
conversus Râvanam, gravissimam mundi pestem, diis insuperabilem, O Vishnus!
proelio caede. Gigas ille vecors Râvanas Deos cum Fidicinum choris, Beatos et
Sapientes praestantissimos vexat, audacia superbiens. Etenim ab hoc furioso
Sapientes Fidicines et nymphae, ludentes in Nandano viridario, sunt proculcati.
Tu es nostrum omnium summa salus, divine bellator! Ut deoram hostes extinguas,
ad sortem humanam animum converte. Augustus ille Nârâyanus, diis hunc
in modum coram hortantibus, eosdem apto hoc sermone compellavit: Quare,
quaeso, hac in re negotium vestrum a me potissimum, corporea specie palam facto,
est peragendum aut unde tantus vobis terror fuit iniectus? His verbis a Vishnû
interrogati Dî talia proferre: Terror nobis instat, O Vishnus! a Râvana mundi
direptore; a quo nos vindicare, corpore humano assumpto, tuum est. Nemo alius
coelicoiarum praeter te hunc scelestum enecare potis est. Nimirum ille, O hostium
domitor! per diuturnum tempus sese excruciaverat severissima abstinentia,
qua magnus hicce rerum Parens propitius ipsi redditus est. Itaque almus votorum
sponsor olim ei concessit securitatem ab ommibus animantibus, hominibus tamen
exceptis. Hinc ilium, voti compotem, non aliunde quam ab homine necis periculum
urget: tu ergo, humanitate assumpta eum intertice. Sic monitus Vishnus,
Superûm princeps, quem mundus universus adorat, magnum Parentem oeterosque
deos, in concilio congregatos, recti auctores, affatur: Mittite timorem; bene
bobis eveniat! Vestrae salutis gratia, postquam praelio necavero Râvanam cum
filiis nepotibusque, cum amicis, ministris, cognatis sociisque, crudelem istum aegre
cohibendum, qui divinis Sapientibus terrorem meutit, per decem millia annorum
decies centenis additis, commorabor in mortalium sedibus, orbem terrarum imperio
regens. Tum divini sapientes et Fidicines conjuncti cum Rudris nympharumque
choris celebravere Madhûs interfectorem hymnis, quales sedem aetheriam
decent.

<p>
<q>Râvanam ilium insolentem, acri impetu actum, superbia elatum, Superûm

<head>Caput XIV. IL MEZZO STABILITO PER UCCIDERE RÁVANO.</head>

<p>
Ma Riseyasringo soggiunse poscia al re: Tappresterò io un altro rito santissimo,
genitale, onde tu conseguisca la prole che tu bramí. E in quel punto
stesso il saggio figliulo di Vibhândaco, intento alla prosperità del re, pose mano
al sacro rito per condurre ad effetto il suo desiderio. Già erano prima, per ricevere
ciascuno la sua parte, qui convenuti al gran sacrifizio del re magnanimo
l'Asvamedha, i Devi coi Gandharvi, i Siddhi e i Muni, Brahma Signor dei Sari,
Sthânu e l' Augusto Nârâyana, i quattio custodi dell' universo e le Madri degli
Iddu, i Yacsi insieme cogli Dei, e il sovrano, venerando Indra, visibile, circondato
<pb n="511"/><anchor id="Pg511"/>
dalla schiera dei Maruti. Quivi così parlò Riscyasringo agli Dei venuti a partecipare
del sacrifizio: Questo è il re Dasaratha, che per desiderio di progenie già
s' astrinse ad osservanze austeré, e testè pieno di fede ha a voi, O eccelsi, sacrificato
con un Asvamedha. Ora egli, sollecito d' aver figli, si dispone ad adempiere
un nuovo rito; vogliate essere favorevole a lui che sospira progenie. Io alzo a
voi supplici le mani, e voi tutti per lui imploro: nascano a lui quattro figli
degni d'essere celebrati pei tre mondi. Risposero gli Dei al supplichevole figliuolo
del Risci: Sia fatto ciò che chiedi; a te ed al re parimente si debbe da noi, O
Brahmano, sommo pregio; canseguirà il re per questo sacro rito il suo suppremo
desiderio. Ciò detto disparvero i Numi preceduti da Indra.
</p>

<p>
Poichè videro gli Dei compiersi debitamente dal gran Risci l'oblazione,
venuti al cospetto di Brahma facitor del mondo, signor delle creature, così parlarono
reverenti a lui dator di grazie: O Brahma, un Racsaso per nome Râvano,
eui tu fosti largo del tuo favore, è per superbia infesto a noi tutti e ai grandi Saggi
penitenti. Un di, O Nume, augusto, tu propizio a lui gli accordasti il favore, ch'
egli bramava, di non poter essere ucciso dagli Dei, dai Dânavi nè dai Yacsi: noi
venerando i tuoi oracoli, ogni cosa sopportiamo da costui. Quindi il signor dei
Racsasi infesta con perpetue offese i tre mondi, i Devi, i Risci, i Yacsi ed i Gandharvi,
gli Asuri e gli uomini: tutti egli opprime indegnamente inorgoglito pel
tuo dono. Colà dove si trova Râvano, più non isfavilla per timore il sole, più
non spira il vento, più non fiammeggia il fuoco: l' oceano stesso cui fan corona
i vasti flutti, veggendo costui, tutto si turba e si commuove. Stretto dalla forza
di costui e ridotto allo stremo dovette Vaisravano abbandonare Lancâ. Da questo
Râvano, terror del mondo, tu ne proteggi, O almo Nume: degna, O dator
d'ogni bene, trovar modo ad estirpar costui. Fatto di queste cose conscio dai
Devi, stette alquanto meditando, poi rispose Brahma: Orsù! è stabilito il modo
onde distruggere questo iniquo. Egli a me chiese, ed io gliel concessi, di non poter
essere ucciso dai Devi, dai Risci, dai Gandharvi, dai Yacsi, dai Racsasi nè dai
Serpenti; ma per disprezzo non fece menzione degli uomini quel Racso: or bene,
sarà quell' empio ucciso da un uomo. Udite le fauste parole profferte da Brahma,
furono per ogni parte liete gli Iddii col loro duce Indra. In questo mezzo quì
sopravvenne raggiante d'immensa luce il venerando Visnu, pensato da Brahma
nell' immortal sua mente, siccome atto ad estirpar colui; Allora Brahma colla
schiera de' Celesti così parlò a Visnu: Tu sei il conforto delle gente oppresse, O
distruttor di Madhu: noi quindi a te supplichiamo afflitti: sia tu nostro sostegno,
O Aciuto. Dite, loro rispose Visnu, quale cosa io debba far per voi; e gli
Dei, udite queste parole, cosi soggiunsero: Un re per nome Dasaratha, giusto,
virtuoso, veridico e pio, non ha progenie e la desidera: ei già s' impose durissime
penitenze, ed ora ha sacrificato con un Asvamedha: tu, per nostro consiglio, O
Visnu, consenti a divenir suo figlio: fatte di te quattro parti, ti manifesta, O
invocato dalle genti, nel seno delle quattro sue consorti, simili alla venusta
Dea. Così esortato dagli Dei quivi presenti, l'augusto Nârâyana loro rispose
queste opportune parole: Quale opra s'ha da me, fatto visible nel mondo, a
compiere per voi, O Devi? e d'onde in voi cotal terrore? Intese le parole di
Visnu, così risposero gli Dei: Il nostro terrore. O Visnu, nasce da un Racsaso per
nome Râvano, spavento dell' universo. Vestendo umano corpo, tu debbi esterminar
costui. Nessuno fra i Celesti, fuorchè tu solo, è valevole ad uccidere
quell' iniquo. Egli, O domator de' tuoi nemici, sostenne per lungo tempo acerbissime
<pb n="512"/><anchor id="Pg512"/>
macerazioni: per esse fu di lui contento l'augusto sommo Genitore: e
un di gli accordò propizio la sicurezza da tutti gli esseri, eccettutine gli uomini.
Per questo favore a lui concesso nou ha egli a temere offesa da alcuna parte,
fuorchè dall' uomo, perciò, assumendo la natura umana, costui tu uccidi. Egli,
il peggior di tutti i Racsasi, insano per la forza che gli infonde il dono avuto, da
travaglio ai Devi ed ai Gaudharvi, ai Risci, ai Muni ed ai mortali. Egli, sicuro
da morte pel favore ottenuto, è turbatore dei sacrifizj, nemico ed uccisor dei
Brahmi, divoratore degli uomini, peste del mondo. Da lui furono assaliti re coi
loro carri ed elefanti; altri percessi e fugati si dispersero per ogni dove. Da lui
furono divorati Risci ed Apsarase: egli insomma oltracotato continuamente e
quasi per ischerzo tutti travaglia i sette mondi. Perciò, O terribile ai nemici è
stabilita la morte di costui per opra d'un uomo; poich' un di per superbia del
dono tutti sprezzò gli uomini. Tu, O supremo fra i Numi, dei, umanandoti,
estirpare questo tremendo, superbo Ràvano, oltracotato, a noi nemico, terrore e
flagello dei penitenti.

<p>
De nouveau Rishyaçringa tint ce langage au Monarque: <q>Je vais célébrer
un autre sacrifice, afin que le ciel accorde à tes vœux les enfants que tu souhaites.</q>
Cela dit, cherchant le bonheur du roi et pour l'accomplissement de son désir, le
fils puissant de Vibhándaka se mit à célébrer ce nouveau sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Là auparavant, étaient venus déjà recevoir une part de l' offrande les
Dieux, accompagnés des Gaudharvas, et les Siddhas avec les Mounis divins,
Brahma, le monarque des Souras, l' immuable Śiva, et l' auguste Náráyana, et les
quatre gardiens vigilants du monde, et les mères des Immortels, et tous les Dieux,
escortés des Yakshas, et le maître éminent du ciel, Indra, qui se manifestait aux
yeux, environné par l' essaim des Maroutes. Alors ce jeune anachorète avait
supplié tous les Dieux, que le désir d'une part dans l' offrande avait conduits á l'
açwamédha, cette grande cérémonie de ce roi magnanime; <hi rend='italic'>et, dans ce
moment, l' époux de Śántá les conjurait ainsi pour la seconde fois</hi>:
<q>Cet homme <hi rend='italic'>en prières</hi>,
c'est le roi Daçaratha, qui est privé de fils. Il est rempli d' une foi vive; il s'est
infligé de pénibles austérités; il vous a déjà servi, divinités augustes, le sacrifice
d'un açwa-médha, et maintenant il s'étudie encore à vous plaire avec ce nouveau
sacrifice dans l'espérance que vous lui donnerez les fils, où tendent ses désirs.
Versez donc sur lui votre bienveillance et daignez sourire à son vœu pour des fils.
C'est pour lui que moi ici, les mains jointes, je vous adresse à tous mes supplications:
envoyez-lui quatre fils, qui soient vantés dans les trois mondes!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ouí! répondirent les Dieux au fils suppliant du rishi; tu mérites que nous
t'écoutions avec faveur, toi, brahme saint, et même, en premier lieu, ce roi.
Comme récompense de ces différents sacrifices, le monarque obtendra cet objet
le plus cher de ses désirs.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ayant aussi parlé et vu que le grand saint avait mis fin suivant les rites à
son <hi rend='italic'>pieux</hi> sacrifice, les Dieux,
Indra à leur tête, s'évanouissent dans le vide des
airs et se rendent vers l' architecte des mondes, le souverain des créatures, le
donateur des biens, vers Brahma enfin, auquel tous, les mains jointes, ils adressent
les paroles suivantes: <q>O Brahma, un rakshasa, nommé Râvana, tourne su
<pb n="513"/><anchor id="Pg513"/>
mal les grâces, qu'il a reçues de toi. Dans son orgueil, il nous opprime tous; il
opprime avec nous les grands anchorètes, qui se font un bonheur des macérations:
car jadis, ayant su te plaire, O Bhagavat, il a reçu de toi ce don incomparable.
<q>Oui, as-tu dit, exauçant le vœu du mauvais Génie; Dieu. Yaksha ou Démon
ne pourra jamais causer ta mort!</q> Et nous, par qui ta parole est respectée, nous
avons tout supporté de ce roi des rakshasas, qui écrase de sa tyrannie les trois
mondes, ou il promène l' injure impunément. Enorgueilli de ce don victorieux,
il opprime indignement les Dieux, les rishis, les Yakshas, les Gandharvas, les
Asouras et les enfants de Manou. Là ou se tient Râvana, la peur empêche le
soleil d'échauffer, le vent craint de souffler, et le feu n'ose flamboyer. A son
aspect, la guirlande même des grands flots tremble au sein de la mer. Accablé
par sa vigueur indomptable, Kouvéra défait lui a cédé Lanká. Suave-nous donc,
ô toi, qui reposes daus le bonheur absolu; sauve-nous de Râvana, le fléau des
mondes. Daigne, ô toi, qui souris aux vœux du suppliant, daigne imaginer un
expedient pour ôter la vie à ce cruel Démon.</q> Les Dieux ayant ainsi dénoncé
leurs maux à Brahma, il réfléchit un instant et leur tint ce langage: <q>Bien, voici
que j'ai découvert un moyen pour tuer ce Génie scélérat. Que ni les Dieux,
a-t-il dit, ni les rishis, ni les Gandharvas ni les Yakshas, ni les rakshasas, ni les
Nágas même ne puissent me donner la mort! Soit lui ai-je répondu. Mais, par
dédain pour la force humaine, les hommes n'ont pas été compris daus sa demande.
C'est donc par la main d' un homme, qu'il faut immoler ce méchant.</q> Ainsi
tombée de la bouche du créateur, cette parole salutaire satisfit pleinement le roi
des habitants du ciel et tous les Dieux avec lui. Lá, dans ce même instant, survint
le fortuné Visnou, revêtu d' une splendeur infinie; car c'était a lui, que
Brahma avait pensé dans son âme pour la mort du tyran. Celui-ci donc avec
l'essaim des Immortels adresse à Vishnou ces paroles: <q>Meurtrier de Madhou,
comme tu aimes á tirer de l'affliction les êtres malheureux, nous te supplions,
nous qui sommes plongés dans la tristesse, Divinité auguste, sois notre asyle!</q>
<q>Dites! reprit Vishnou; que dois-je faire?</q> <q>Ayant oui les paroles de l'ineffable,
tous les Dieux repondirent: Il est un roi nommé Daçaratha; il a embrassé une
très-duré pénitence; il a célébré même le sacrifice d'un açwa-medha, parce qu'il
n'a point de fils et qu'il veut en obtenir du ciel. Il est inébranlable dans sa piété,
il est vanté pour ses vertus; la justice est son caractère, la verite est sa parole.
Acquiesce donc à notre demande, ô toi, Vishnou, et consens à naître comme son
fils. Divisé en quatre portions de toi-même, daigne, ô toi, qui foules aux pieds
tes ennemis, daigne t' incarner dans le sein de ses trois épouses, belles comme la
déesse de la beauté.</q> Náráyana, le maître, <hi rend='italic'>non perceptible aux sens,
mais qui alors s' était rendu</hi> visible, Náráyana répondit cette parole salutaire aux
Dieux, qui i invitaient à cet <hi rend='italic'>heroique avatára</hi>. Quelle chose, une
fois revêtu de cette
incarnation, faudra-t-il encore que je fasse pour vous, et de quelle part vient la
terreur, qui vous trouble ainsi? A ces mots du grand Vishnou: <q>C'est le
démon Rávana, reprirent les Dieux; c'est lui, Vishnou, cette désolation des
mondes, qui nous inspire un tel effroi. Enveloppe-toi d'un corps, humain, et
qu'il te plaise arrâcher du monde cette blessante epine; car nul autre que toi
parmi les habitants du ciel n'est capable d'immoler ce pécheur. <hi rend='italic'>Sache
que</hi> longtemps il s'est imposé la plus austére pénitence, et
<hi rend='italic'>que</hi> par elle il s'est rendu
agreable au suprême ayeul de toutes les créatures. Aussi le distributeur ineffable
des gràces lui a-t-il accordé ce don insigne d'être invulnérable à tous les êtres, l'
<pb n="514"/><anchor id="Pg514"/>
homme seul excepté. Puisque, doué ainsi de cette faveur, la mort terrible et
sûre ne peut venir à lui de nulle autre part que de l'homme, va,
dompteur <hi rend='italic'>puissant</hi>
de tes ennemis, va dans la condition humaine, et tue-le. Car ce don, auquel on
ne peut résister, élevant au plus haut point l'ivresse de sa force, le vil rakshasa
tourmente les Dieux, les rishis, les Gandharvas, les hommes sanctifiés par la
pénitence; et, quoique, destructeur des sacrifices, lacérateur des Saintes Ecritures,
ennemi des brahmes, dévorateur des hommes, cette faveur incomparable sauve de
la mort Rávana le triste fléau des mondes. Il ose attaquer les rois, que défendant
les chars de guerre, que remparent les élephants: d'autres blessés et mis en fuite,
sont dissipés ça et là devant lui. Il a dévoré des saints, il a dévoré même une
foule d'apsaras. Sans cesse, dans son délire, il s'amuse à tourmenter les sept
mondes. Comme <hi rend='italic'>on vient de nous apprendre qu'</hi> il n'a
point daigné parler d'eux
ce jour, que lui fut donnée cette faveur, <hi rend='italic'>dont il abuse</hi>,
entre dans un corps humain,

<head>Uttarakánda.</head>

<p>
The Rámáyan ends, epically complete, with the triumphant return of
Ráma and his rescued queen to Ayodhyá and his consecration and coronation in
the capital of his forefathers. Even if the story were not complete, the conclusion
of the last Canto of the sixth Book, evidently the work of a later hand than Válmíki's,
which speaks of Ráma's glorious and happy reign and promises blessings
to those who read and hear the Rámáyan, would be sufficient to show that, when
these verses were added, the poem was considered to be finished. The Uttarakáṇḍa
or Last Book is merely an appendix or a supplement and relates only events antecedent
and subsequent to those described in the original poem. Indian scholars
however, led by reverential love of tradition, unanimously ascribe this Last Book
to Válmíki, and regard it as part of the Rámáyan.
</p>

<p>
Signor Gorresio has published an excellent translation of the Uttarakáṇḍa,
in Italian prose, from the recension current in Bengal;<note place="foot"><hi
rend='italic'>The Academy</hi>, Vol. III., No 43, contains an able and interesting notice
of this work from the pen of the Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Cambridge:
<q>The <hi rend='italic'>Uttarakáṇḍa</hi>,</q> Mr. Cowell remarks, <q>bears the same
relation to the <hi rend='italic'>Rámáyaṇa</hi> as the Cyclic poems to the <hi
rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>.
Just as the <hi rend='italic'>Cypria</hi> of Stasinus, the
<hi rend='italic'>Æthiopis</hi> of Arctinus, and the little <hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>
of Lesches completed the story of the
<hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>, and not only added the series of events which preceded and
followed it, but also founded episodes of their own on isolated allusions in Homer, so
the <hi rend='italic'>Uttarakáṇḍa</hi> is intended to complete the <hi
rend='italic'>Rámáyaṇa</hi>, and at the same time to
supplement it by intervening episodes to explain casual allusions or isolated incidents
which occur in it. Thus the early history of the giant Rávaṇa and his
family fills nearly forty Chapters, and we have a full account of his wars with
the gods and his conquest of Lanká, which all happened long before the action
of the poem commences, just as the <hi rend='italic'>Cypria</hi> narrated the birth and
early history of Helen, and the two expeditions of the Greeks against Troy; and the
latter chapters continue the history of the hero Ráma after his triumphant return to
his paternal kingdom, and the poem closes with his death and that of his brothers,
and the founding by their descendants of various kingdoms in different parts
of India.</q></note> and Mr. Muir has epitomized
a portion of the book in the Appendix to the Fourth Part of his Sanskrit
Texts (1862). From these scholars I borrow freely in the following pages, and
give them my hearty thanks for saving me much wearisome labour.

<p>
<q>After Ráma had returned to Ayodhyá and taken possession of the throne,
the rishis [saints] assembled to greet him, and Agastya, in answer to his questions
recounted many particulars regarding his old enemies. In the Krita Yuga (or
Golden Age) the austere and pious Brahman rishi Pulastya, a son of Brahmá,
being teased with the visits of different damsels, proclaimed that any one of them
whom he again saw near his hermitage should become pregnant. This had not
been heard by the daughter of the royal rishi Triṇavindu, who one day came into
Pulastya's neighbourhood, and her pregnancy was the result (Sect. 2, vv. 14 ff.).
After her return home, her father, seeing her condition, took her to Pulastya, who
accepted her as his wife, and she bore a son who received the name of Viśravas.
This son was, like his father, an austere and religious sage. He married the
daughter of the muni Bharadvája, who bore him a son to whom Brahmá gave the
name of Vaiśravaṇ-Kuvera (Sect. 3, vv. 1 ff.). He performed austerities for
thousands of years, when he obtained from Brahmá as a boon that he should be
one of the guardians of the world (along with Indra, Varuṇa, and Yáma) and
the god of riches. He afterwards consulted his father Viśravas about an abode,
and at his suggestion took possession of the city of Lanká, which had formerly
been built by Viśvakarmán for the Rákshasas, but had been abandoned by them
through fear of Vishṇu, and was at that time unoccupied. Ráma then (Sect. 4)
says he is surprised to hear that Lanká had formerly belonged to the Rákshasas, as
he had always understood that they were the descendants of Pulastya, and now
he learns that they had also another origin. He therefore asks who was their
ancestor, and what fault they had committed that they were chased away by
Vishṇu. Agastya replies that when Brahmá created the waters, he formed certain
beings,—some of whom received the name of Rákshasas,—to guard them. The
first Rákshasas kings were Heti and Praheti. Heti married a sister of Kála (Time).
She bore him a son Vidyutkeśa, who in his turn took for his wife Lankatanka[t.]á,
the daughter of Sandhyá (V. 21). She bore him a son Sukeśa, whom she abandoned,
but he was seen by Śiva as he was passing by with his wife Párvatí, who
made the child as old as his mother, and immortal, and gave him a celestial city.
Sukeśa married a Gandharví called Devavatí who bore three sons, Mályavat,
Sumáli and Máli. These sons practised intense austerities, when Brahmá appeared
and conferred on them invincibility and long life. They then harassed the gods.
Viśvakarmá gave them a city, Lanká, on the mountain Trikúṭa, on the shore of
<pb n="516"/><anchor id="Pg516"/>
the southern ocean, which he had built at the command of Indra.… The three
Rákshasa, Mályavat and his two brothers, then began to oppress the gods, rishis,
etc.; who (Sect. 6, v. 1 ff.) in consequence resort for aid to Mahádeva, who having
regard to his protégé Sukeśa the father of Mályavat, says that he cannot kill
the Rákshasas, but advises the suppliants to go to Vishṇu, which they do, and
receive from him a promise that he will destroy their enemies. The three Rákshasa
kings, hearing of this, consult together, and proceed to heaven to attack the gods.
Vishṇu prepares to meet them. The battle is described in the seventh section.
The Rákshasas are defeated by Vishṇu with great slaughter, and driven back to
Lanká, one of their leaders, Máli, being slain. Mályavat remonstrates with
Vishṇu, who was assaulting the rear of the fugitives, for his unwarrior-like conduct,
and wishes to renew the combat (Sect. 8, v. 3 ff.). Vishṇu replies that he
must fulfil his promise to the gods by slaying the Rákshasas, and that he would
destroy them even if they fled to Pátála. These Rákshasas, Agastya says, were
more powerful than Rávaṇa, and, could only be destroyed by Náráyaṇa, <hi
rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> by
Ráma himself, the eternal, indestructible god. Sumáli with his family lived for
along time in Pátála, while Kuvera dwelt in Lanká. In section 9 it is related
that Sumáli once happened to visit the earth, when he observed Kuvera going in
his chariot to see his father Viśravas. This leads him to consider how he might
restore his own fortunes. He consequently desires his daughter Kaikasí to go and
woo Viśravas, who receives her graciously. She becomes the mother of the dreadful
Rávaṇa, of the huge Kumbhakarṇa, of Śúrpaṇakhá, and of the righteous
Vibhishaṇa, who was the last son. These children grow up in the forest. Kumbhakarṇa
goes about eating rishis. Kuvera comes to visit his father, when Kaikasí
takes occasion to urge her son Rávaṇa to strive to become like his brother (Kuvera)
in splendour. This Rávaṇa promises to do. He then goes to the hermitage of
Gokarna with his brothers to perform austerity. In section 10 their austere observances
are described: after a thousand years' penance Rávaṇa throws his head
into the fire. He repeats this oblation nine times after equal intervals, and is
about to do it the tenth time, when Brahmá appears, and offers a boon. Rávaṇa
asks immortality, but is refused. He then asks that he may be indestructible by
all creatures more powerful than men; which boon is accorded by Brahmá
together with the recovery of all the heads he had sacrificed and the power of
assuming any shape he pleased. Vibhishaṇa asks as his boon that even amid
the greatest calamities he may think only of righteousness, and that the weapon
of Brahmá may appear to him unlearnt, etc. The god grants his request, and
adds the gift of immortality. When Brahmá is about to offer a boon to Kumbhakarṇa,
the gods interpose, as, they say, he had eaten seven Apsarases and ten
followers of Indra, besides rishis and men; and beg that under the guise of a
boon stupefaction may be inflicted on him. Brahmá thinks on Sarasvatí, who
arrives and, by Brahmá's command, enters into Kumbhakarṇa's mouth that she
may speak for him. Under this influence he asks that he may receive the boon
of sleeping for many years, which is granted. When however Sarasvatí has left
him, and he recovers his own consciousness, he perceives that he has been deluded.
Kuvera by his father's advice, gives up the city of Lanká to Rávaṇ.</q><note
place="foot"><hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Muir</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Sanskrit Texts,</hi> Part IV., pp. 414 ff.</note> Rávaṇa
marries (Sect. 12) Mandodarí the beautiful daughter of the Asur Maya whose
<pb n="517"/><anchor id="Pg517"/>
name has several times occurred in the Rámáyan as that of an artist of wonderful
skill. She bears a son Meghanáda or the Roaring Cloud who was afterwards
named Indrajít from his victory over the sovereign of the skies. The conquest
of Kuvera, and the acquisition of the magic self-moving chariot which has done
much service in the Rámáyan, form the subject of sections XIII., XIV. and XV.
<q>The rather pretty story of Vedavatí is related in the seventeenth section, as
follows: Rávaṇa in the course of his progress through the world, comes to the
forest on the Himálaya, where he sees a damsel of brilliant beauty, but in ascetic
garb, of whom he straightway becomes enamoured. He tells her that such an
austere life is unsuited to her youth and attractions, and asks who she is and why
she is leading an ascetic existence. She answers that she is called Vedavatí, and
is the vocal daughter of Vṛihaspati's son, the rishi Kuśadhwaja, sprung from him
during his constant study of the Veda. The gods, gandharvas, etc., she says,
wished that she should choose a husband, but her father would give her to no one
else than to Vishṇu, the lord of the world, whom he desired for his son-in-law.
Vedavatí then proceeds: <q>In order that I may fulfil this desire of my father in
respect of Náráyaṇa, I wed him with my heart. Having entered into this engagement
I practise great austerity. Náráyaṇa and no other than he, Purushottama,
is my husband. From the desire of obtaining him, I resort to this severe observance.</q>
Rávaṇa's passion is not in the least diminished by this explanation and
he urges that it is the old alone who should seek to become distinguished by
accumulating merit through austerity, prays that she who is so young and beautiful
shall become his bride; and boasts that he is superior to Vishṇu. She rejoins
that no one but he would thus contemn that deity. On receiving this reply he
touches the hair of her head with the tip of his finger. She is greatly incensed,
and forthwith cuts off her hair and tells him that as he has so insulted her, she
cannot continue to live, but will enter into the fire before his eyes. She goes on
<q>Since I have been insulted in the forest by thee who art wicked-hearted, I shall
be born again for thy destruction. For a man of evil desire cannot be slain by a
woman; and the merit of my austerity would be lost if I were to launch a curse
against thee. But if I have performed or bestowed or sacrificed aught may I be
born the virtuous daughter, not produced from the womb, of a righteous man.</q>
Having thus spoken she entered the blazing fire. Then a shower of celestial
flowers fell (from every part of the sky). It is she, lord, who, having been Vedavatí
in the Krita age, has been born (in the Treta age) as the daughter of the
king of the Janakas, and (has become) thy [Ráma's] bride; for thou art the
eternal Vishṇu. The mountain-like enemy who was [virtually] destroyed before
by her wrath, has now been slain by her having recourse to thy superhuman
energy.</q> On this the commentator remarks: <q>By this it is signified that Sítá
was the principal cause of Rávaṇa's death; but the function of destroying him
is ascribed to Ráma.</q> On the words, <q>thou art Vishṇu,</q> in the preceding verse
the same commentator remarks: <q>By this it is clearly affirmed that Sítá was
Lakshmí.</q> This is what Paráśara says: <q>In the god's life as Ráma, she became
Sítá, and in his birth as Krishṇa [she became] Rukminí.</q><note place="foot"><hi

</p>

<p>
In the following section (XVIII.) <q>Rávaṇa is described as violently interrupting
a sacrifice which is being performed by king Marutta, and the assembled
<pb n="518"/><anchor id="Pg518"/>
gods in terror assume different shapes to escape; Indra becomes a peacock, Yáma
a crow, Kuvera a lizard, and Varuṇa a swan; and each deity bestows a boon on
the animal he had chosen. The peacock's tail recalls Indra's thousand eyes; the
swan's colour becomes white, like the foam of the ocean (Varuṇa being its lord);
the lizard obtains a golden colour; and the crow is never to die except when
killed by a violent death, and the dead are to enjoy the funeral oblations when
they have been devoured by the crows.</q><note place="foot">See
<hi rend='italic'>Academy</hi>, III., 43.</note></p>

<p>
Rávaṇ then attacks Arjuna or Kárttavírya the mighty king of Máhishmati
on the banks of the Narmadá, and is defeated, captured and imprisoned by
Arjuna. At the intercession of Pulastya (Sect. XXII.) he is released from his
bonds. He then visits Kishkindhá where he enters into alliance with Báli the
King of the Vánars: <q>We will have all things in common,</q> says Rávaṇ, <q>dames,
sons, cities and kingdoms, food, vesture, and all delights.</q> His next exploit is
the invasion of the kingdom of departed spirits and his terrific battle with the
sovereign Yáma. The poet in his description of these regions with the detested
river with waves of blood, the dire lamentations, the cries for a drop of water,
the devouring worm, all the tortures of the guilty and the somewhat insipid pleasures
of the just, reminds one of the scenes in the under world so vividly described
by Homer, Virgil, and Dante. Yáma is defeated (Sect. XXVI.) by the giant, not
so much by his superior power as because at the request of Brahmá Yáma refrains
from smiting with his deadly weapon the Rákshas enemy to whom that God had
once given the promise that preserved him. In the twenty-seventh section Rávaṇ
goes <q>under the earth into Pátála the treasure-house of the waters inhabited by
swarms of serpents and Daityas, and well defended by Varuṇ.</q> He subdues
Bhogavatí the city ruled by Vásuki and reduces the Nágas or serpents to subjection.
He penetrates even to the imperial seat of Varuṇ. The God himself is
absent, but his sons come forth and do battle with the invader. The giant is
victorious and departs triumphant. The twenty-eighth section gives the details
of a terrific battle between Rávaṇ and Mándhátá King of Ayodhyá, a distinguished
ancestor of Ráma. Supernatural weapons are employed on both sides and the
issue of the conflict is long doubtful. But at last Mándhátá prepares to use the
mighty weapon <q>acquired by severe austerities through the grace and favour of
Rudra.</q> The giant would inevitably have been slain. But two pre-eminent
Munis Pulastya and Gálava beheld the fight through the power given by contemplation,
and with words of exhortation they parted King Mándhátá and the
sovereign of the Rákshases. Rávaṇ at last (Sect. XXXII.) returns homeward
carrying with him in his car Pushpak the virgin daughters of kings, of Rishis,
of Daityas, and Gandharvas whom he has seized upon his way. The thirty-sixth
section describes a battle with Indra, in which the victorious Meghanáda son of
the giant, makes the King of the Gods his prisoner, binds him with his magic art,
and carries him away (Sect. XXVII.) in triumph to Lanká. Brahmá intercedes
(Sect. XXXVIII.) and Indrajít releases his prisoner on obtaining in return the
boon that sacrifice to the Lord of Fire shall always make him invincible in the
coming battle. In sections XXXIX., XL, <q>we have a legend related to Ráma
by the sage Agastya to account for the stupendous strength of the monkey Hanumán,
as it had been described in the <hi rend='italic'>Rámáyaṇa</hi>. Rama naturally wonders

perhaps many readers of the <hi rend='italic'>Rámáyaṇa</hi> have done since) why a monkey
of such marvellous power and prowess had not easily overcome Báli and secured the throne
for his friend Sugríva. Agastya replies that Hanumán was at that time under
a curse from a Rishi, and consequently was not conscious of his own might.</q><note
place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Academy</hi>, Vol. III., No. 43.</note> The whole story of
the marvellous Vánar is here given at length, but nothing else
of importance is added to the tale already given in the Rámáyaṇa. The Rishis
or saints then (Sect. XL.) return to their celestial seats, and the Vánars, Rákshases
and bears also (Sect. XLIII.) take their departure. The chariot Pushpak is restored
to its original owner Kuvera, as has already been related in the Rámáyaṇ.
</p>

<p>
The story of Ráma and Sítá is then continued, and we meet with matter
of more human interest. The winter is past and the pleasant spring-time is come,
and Ráma and Sítá sit together in the shade of the Aśoka trees happy as Indra
and Śachí when they drink in Paradise the nectar of the Gods. <q>Tell me, my
beloved,</q> says Ráma, <q>for thou wilt soon be a mother, hast thou a wish in thy
heart for me to gratify?</q> And Sítá smiles and answers: <q>I long, O son of Raghu,
to visit the pure and holy hermitages on the banks of the Ganges and to venerate
the feet of the saints who there perform their rigid austerities and live on roots
and berries. This is my chief desire, to stand within the hermits' grove were it
but for a single day.</q> And Ráma said: <q>Let not the thought trouble thee: thou
shalt go to the grove of the ascetics.</q> But slanderous tongues have been busy in
Ayodhyá, and Sítá has not been spared. Ráma hears that the people are lamenting
his blind folly in taking back to his bosom the wife who was so long a captive
in the palace of Rávaṇ. Ráma well knows her spotless purity in thought, word,
and deed, and her perfect love of him; but he cannot endure the mockery and
the shame and resolves to abandon his unsuspecting wife. He orders the sad but
still obedient Lakshmaṇ to convey her to the hermitage which she wishes to visit
and to leave her there, for he will see her face again no more. They arrive at the
hermitage, and Lakshmaṇ tells her all. She falls fainting on the ground, and
when she recovers her consciousness sheds some natural tears and bewails her
cruel and undeserved lot. But she resolves to live for the sake of Ráma and her
unborn son, and she sends by Lakshmaṇ a dignified message to the husband who
has forsaken her: <q>I grieve not for myself,</q> she says <q>because I have been
abandoned on account of what the people say, and not for any evil that I have
done. The husband is the God of the wife, the husband is her lord and guide;
and what seems good unto him she should do even at the cost of her life.</q>
</p>

<p>
Sítá is honourably received by the saint Válmíki himself, and the holy
women of the hermitage are charged to entertain and serve her. In this calm
retreat she gives birth to two boys who receive the names of Kuśa and Lava.
They are carefully brought up and are taught by Válmíki himself to recite the
Rámáyaṇ. The years pass by: and Ráma at length determines to celebrate the
Aśvamedha or Sacrifice of the Steed. Válmíki, with his two young pupils,
attends the ceremony, and the unknown princes recite before the delighted father
the poem which recounts his deeds. Ráma inquires into their history and recognizes
them as his sons. Sítá is invited to return and solemnly affirm her innocence
before the great assembly.
</p>

<p>
<q>But Sítá's heart was too full; this second ordeal was beyond even her
power to submit to, and the poet rose above the ordinary Hindu level of women
<pb n="520"/><anchor id="Pg520"/>
when he ventured to paint her conscious purity as rebelling: <q>Beholding all the
spectators, and clothed in red garments, Sítá clasping her hands and bending low
her face, spoke thus in a voice choked with tears: <q>as I, even in mind, have never
thought of any other than Ráma, so may Mádhaví the goddess of Earth, grant
me a hiding-place.</q> As Sítá made this oath, lo! a marvel appeared. Suddenly
cleaving the earth, a divine throne of marvellous beauty rose up, borne by resplendent
dragons on their heads: and seated on it, the goddess of Earth, raising
Sítá with her arm, said to her, <q>Welcome to thee!</q> and placed her by her side.
And as the queen, seated on the throne, slowly descended to Hades, a continuous
shower of flowers fell down from heaven on her head.</q><note place="foot">E. B. Cowell.

roughly translated from the <hi rend='italic'>Raghuvaṇśa</hi>, in the Additional Notes.
</note></q></p>

<p>
<q>Both the great Hindu epics thus end in disappointment and sorrow. In
the <hi rend='italic'>Mahábhárata</hi> the five victorious brothers abandon the hardly
won throne to die one by one in a forlorn pilgrimage to the Himálaya; and in the same way
Ráma only regains his wife, after all his toils, to lose her. It is the same in the
later Homeric cycle—the heroes of the <hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>
perish by ill-fated deaths. And even
Ulysses, after his return to Ithaca, sets sail again to Thesprotia, and finally falls
by the hand of his own son. But in India and Greece alike this is an afterthought
of a self-conscious time, which has been subsequently added to cast a
gloom on the strong cheerfulness of the heroic age.</q><note place="foot">E. B. Cowell.
<hi rend='italic'>Academy</hi>, Vol, III, No. 43.</note></p>

<p>
<q>The termination of Ráma's terrestrial career is thus told in Sections 116
ff. of the Uttarakáṇda. Time, in the form of an ascetic, comes to his palace gate,
and asks, as the messenger of the great rishi (Brahmá) to see Ráma. He is admitted
and received with honour, but says, when he is asked what he has to
communicate, that his message must be delivered in private, and that any one
who witnesses the interview is to lose his life. Ráma informs Lakshmaṇ of all
this, and desires him to stand outside. Time then tells Ráma that he has been
sent by Brahmá, to say that when he (Ráma, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> Vishṇu) after
destroying the worlds was sleeping on the ocean, he had formed him (Brahmá) from the
lotus springing from his navel, and committed to him the work of creation; that he
(Brahmá) had then entreated Ráma to assume the function of Preserver, and
that the latter had in consequence become Vishṇu, being born as the son of Aditi,
and had determined to deliver mankind by destroying Rávaṇa, and to live on
earth ten thousand and ten hundred years; that period, adds Time, was now on
the eve of expiration, and Ráma could either at his pleasure prolong his stay on
earth, or ascend to heaven and rule over the gods. Ráma replies, that he had
been born for the good of the three worlds, and would now return to the place
whence he had come, as it was his function to fulfil the purposes of the gods.
While they are speaking the irritable rishi Durvásas comes, and insists on seeing
Ráma immediately, under a threat, if refused, of cursing Ráma and all his
family.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lakshmaṇ, preferring to save his kinsman, though knowing that his own
death must be the consequence of interrupting the interview of Ráma with Time,
enters the palace and reports the rishi's message to Ráma. Ráma comes out, and
<pb n="521"/><anchor id="Pg521"/>
when Durvásas has got the food he wished, and departed, Ráma reflects with
great distress on the words of Time, which require that Lakshmaṇ should die.
Lakshmaṇ however exhorts Ráma not to grieve, but to abandon him and not break
his own promise. The counsellors concurring in this advice, Ráma abandons
Lakshmaṇ, who goes to the river Sarayú, suppresses all his senses, and is conveyed
bodily by Indra to heaven. The gods are delighted by the arrival of the fourth
part of Vishṇu. Ráma then resolves to install Bharata as his successor and retire
to the forest and follow Lakshmaṇ. Bharata however refuses the succession, and
determines to accompany his brother. Ráma's subjects are filled with grief, and
say they also will follow him wherever he goes. Messengers are sent to Śatrughna,
the other brother, and he also resolves to accompany Ráma; who at length sets
out in procession from his capital with all the ceremonial appropriate to the
<q>great departure,</q> silent, indifferent to external objects, joyless, with Śrí on his
right, the goddess Earth on his left, Energy in front, attended by all his weapons
in human shapes, by the Vedas in the forms of Bráhmans, by the Gáyatrí, the
Omkára, the Vashaṭkára, by rishis, by his women, female slaves, eunuchs, and
servants. Bharata with his family, and Śatrughna, follow together with Bráhmans
bearing the sacred fire, and the whole of the people of the country, and
even with animals, etc., etc. Ráma, with all these attendants, comes to the banks
of the Sarayú. Brahmá, with all the gods and innumerable celestial cars, now
appears, and all the sky is refulgent with the divine splendour. Pure and fragrant
breezes blow, a shower of flowers falls. Ráma enters the waters of the
Sarayú; and Brahmá utters a voice from the sky, saying: <q>Approach, Vishṇu;
Rághava, thou hast happily arrived, with thy godlike brothers. Enter thine own
body as Vishṇu or the eternal ether. For thou art the abode of the worlds: no
one comprehends thee, the inconceivable and imperishable, except the large-eyed
Máyá thy primeval spouse.</q> Hearing these words, Ráma enters the glory of
Vishṇu with his body and his followers. He then asks Brahmá to find an abode
for the people who had accompanied him from devotion to his person, and Brahmá
appoints them a celestial residence accordingly.<note place="foot"><hi

<q>A curious festival is celebrated in honour of this divinity (Lakshmî) on the
fifth lunar day of the light half of the month Mâgha (February), when she is
identified with Saraswatí the consort of Brahmá, and the goddess of learning. In
his treatise on festivals, a great modern authority, Raghunandana, mentions, on
the faith of a work called <hi rend='italic'>Samvatsara-sandipa</hi>,
that Lakshmî is to be worshipped
in the forenoon of that day with flowers, perfumes, rice, and water; that due
honour is to be paid to inkstand and writing-reed, and no writing to be done.
Wilson, in his essay on the <hi rend='italic'>Religious Festivals of the Hindus</hi>
(works, vol. ii, p.
188. ff.) adds that on the morning of the 2nd February, the whole of the pens and
inkstands, and the books, if not too numerous and bulky, are collected, the pens
or reeds cleaned, the inkstands scoured, and the books wrapped up in new cloth,
are arranged upon a platform, or a sheet, and strewn over with flowers and blades
of young barley, and that no flowers except white are to be offered. After performing
the necessary rites, … all the members of the family assemble and
make their prostrations; the books, the pens, and ink having an entire holiday;
and should any emergency require a written communication on the day dedicated
to the divinity of scholarship, it is done with chalk or charcoal upon a black or
white board.</q>

<p>
<q rend="pre">The second person of the Hindu triad, and the most celebrated and popular
of all the Indian deities. He is the personification of the preserving power,
and became incarnate in nine different forms, for the preservation of mankind
in various emergencies. Before the creation of the universe, and after its temporary
annihilation, he is supposed to sleep on the waters, floating on the serpent
Śesha, and is then identified with Náráyaṇa. Brahmá, the creator, is fabled to
spring at that time from a lotus which grows from his navel, whilst thus asleep.…
His ten avatárs or incarnations are:</q>
</p>

<pb n="523"/><anchor id="Pg523"/>

<p>
<q>1. The Matsya, or fish. In this avatár Vishṇu descended in the form of a
fish to save the pious king Satyavrata, who with the seven Rishis and their wives
had taken refuge in the ark to escape the deluge which then destroyed the
earth. 2, The Kúrma, or Tortoise. In this he descended in the form of a tortoise,
for the purpose of restoring to man some of the comforts lost during the flood.
To this end he stationed himself at the bottom of the ocean, and allowed the
point of the great mountain Mandara to be placed upon his back, which served
as a hard axis, whereon the gods and demons, with the serpent Vásuki twisted
round the mountain for a rope, churned the waters for the recovery of the amrita
or nectar, and fourteen other sacred things. 3. The Varáha, or Boar. In this he
descended in the form of a boar to rescue the earth from the power of a demon
called <q>golden-eyed,</q> Hiraṇyáksha. This demon had seized on the earth and
carried it with him into the depths of the ocean. Vishṇu dived into the abyss,
and after a contest of a thousand years slew the monster. 4. The Narasinha, or
Man-lion. In this monstrous shape of a creature half-man, half-lion, Vishṇu
delivered the earth from the tyranny of an insolent demon called Hiraṇyakaśipu.
5. Vámana, or Dwarf. This avatár happened in the second age of the Hindús
or Tretáyug, the four preceding are said to have occurred in the first or Satyayug;
the object of this avatár was to trick Bali out of the dominion of the three worlds.
Assuming the form of a wretched dwarf he appeared before the king and asked,
as a boon, as much land as he could pace in three steps. This was granted; and
Vishṇu immediately expanding himself till he filled the world, deprived Bali at
two steps of heaven and earth, but in consideration of some merit, left Pátála
still in his dominion. 6. Paraśuráma. 7. Rámchandra. 8. Krishṇa, or according
to some Balaráma. 9. Buddha. In this avatár Vishṇu descended in the form
of a sage for the purpose of making some reform in the religion of the Brahmins,
and especially to reclaim them from their proneness to animal sacrifice. Many
of the Hindús will not allow this to have been an incarnation of their favourite
god. 10. Kalki, or White Horse. This is yet to come. Vishṇu mounted on a
white horse, with a drawn scimitar, blazing like a comet, will, according to
prophecy, end this present age, viz. the fourth or Kaliyug, by destroying the
world, and then renovating creation by an age of purity.</q>

<p>
<q>A celebrated Hindú God, the Destroyer of creation, and therefore the most
formidable of the Hindú Triad. He also personifies reproduction, since the
Hindú philosophy excludes the idea of total annihilation without subsequent regeneration.
Hence he is sometimes confounded with Brahmá, the creator or
first person of the Triad. He is the particular God of the Tántrikas, or followers
of the books called Tantras. His worshippers are termed Śaivas, and although
not so numerous as the Vaishṇavas, exalt their god to the highest place in the
heavens, and combine in him many of the attributes which properly belong to the
other deities. According to them Śiva is Time, Justice, Fire, Water, the Sun, the
Destroyer and Creator. As presiding over generation, his type is the Linga, or
Phallus, the origin probably of the Phallic emblem of Egypt and Greece. As
the God of generation and justice, which latter character he shares with the god
Yama, he is represented riding a white bull. His own colour, as well as that of
the bull, is generally white, referring probably to the unsullied purity of Justice.
<pb n="524"/><anchor id="Pg524"/>
His throat is dark-blue; his hair of a light reddish colour, and thickly matted
together, and gathered above his head like the hair of an ascetic. He is sometimes
seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten, and with five faces.
He has three eyes, one being in the centre of his forehead, pointing up and down.
These are said to denote his view of the three divisions of time, past, present, and
future. He holds a trident in his hand to denote, as some say, his relationship to
water, or according to others, to show that the three great attributes of Creator,
Destroyer, and Regenerator are combined in him. His loins are enveloped in a
tiger's skin. In his character of Time, he not only presides over its extinction,
but also its astronomical regulation. A crescent or half-moon on his forehead
indicates the measure of time by the phases of the moon; a serpent forms one of
his necklaces to denote the measure of time by years, and a second necklace of
human skulls marks the lapse and revolution of ages, and the extinction and
succession of the generations of mankind. He is often represented as entirely
covered with serpents, which are the emblems of immortality. They are bound
in his hair, round his neck, wrists, waist, arms and legs; they serve as rings for
his fingers, and earrings for his ears, and are his constant companions. Śiva has
more than a thousand names which are detailed at length in the sixty-ninth
chapter of the Śiva Puráṇa.</q>—<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Williams's

<head>Apsarases.</head>

<p>
<q>Originally these deities seem to have been personifications of the vapours
which are attracted by the sun, and form into mist or clouds: their character
may be thus interpreted in the few hymns of the Rigveda where mention is made
of them. At a subsequent period when the Gandharva of the Rigveda who personifies
there especially the Fire of the Sun, expanded into the Fire of Lightning,
the rays of the moon and other attributes of the elementary life of heaven
as well as into pious acts referring to it, the Apsarasas become divinities
which represent phenomena or objects both of a physical and ethical kind closely
associated with that life; thus in the <hi rend='italic'>Yajurveda</hi>
Sunbeams are called the Apsarasas
associated with the Gandharva who is the Sun; Plants are termed the
Apsarasas connected with the Gandharva Fire: Constellations are the Apsarasas
of the Gandharva Moon: Waters the Apsarasas of the Gandharva Wind, etc.
etc.… In the last Mythological epoch when the Gandharvas have saved
from their elementary nature merely so much as to be musicians in the paradise
of Indra, the Apsarasas appear among other subordinate deities which share in
the merry life of Indra's heaven, as the wives of the Gandharvas, but more
especially as wives of a licentious sort, and they are promised therefore, too, as a
reward to heroes fallen in battle when they are received in the paradise of Indra;
and while, in the Rigveda, they assist Soma to pour down his floods, they descend
in the epic literature on earth merely to shake the virtue of penitent Sages and
to deprive them of the power they would otherwise have acquired through unbroken
austerities.</q>—<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Goldstücker's</hi>

<head>Vishnu's Incarnation As Ráma.</head>

<p>
<q rend="pre">Here is described one of the <hi rend='italic'>avatárs</hi>,
descents or manifestations of Vishṇu
in a visible form. The word <hi rend='italic'>avatár</hi> signifies literally
<hi rend='italic'>descent</hi>. The <hi rend='italic'>avatár</hi> which
is here spoken of, that in which, according to Indian traditions, Vishṇu descended
<pb n="525"/><anchor id="Pg525"/>
and appeared upon earth in the corporeal form of Ráma, the hero of the Rámáyana,
is the seventh in the series of Indian <hi rend='italic'>avatárs</hi>. Much has been
said before now of these avatárs, and through deficient knowledge of the ideas and
doctrines of India, they have been compared to the sublime dogma of the Christian
Incarnation. This is one of the grossest errors that ignorance of the ideas and beliefs
of a people has produced. Between the <hi rend='italic'>avatárs</hi> of India and
the Christian Incarnation
there is such an immensity of difference that it is impossible to find any
reasonable analogy that can approximate them. The idea of the <hi
rend='italic'>avatárs</hi> is intimately
united with that of the Trimúrti; the bond of connection between these
two ideas is an essential notion common to both, the notion of Vishṇu. What
is the Trimúrti? I have already said that it is composed of three Gods, Brahmá
(masculine), Vishṇu the God of <hi rend='italic'>avatárs</hi>, and Śiva.
These three Gods, who when
reduced to their primitive and most simple expression are but three cosmogonical
personifications, three powers or forces of nature, these Gods, I say, are here
found, according to Indian doctrines, entirely external to the true God of India,
or Brahma in the neuter gender. Brahma is alone, unchangeable in the midst of
creation: all emanates from him, he comprehends all, but he remains extraneous
to all: he is Being and the negation of beings. Brahma is never worshipped;
the indeterminate Being is never invoked; he is inaccessible to the prayers as
the actions of man; humanity, as well as nature, is extraneous to him. External
to Brahma rises the Trimúrti, that is to say, Brahmá (masculine) the power
which creates, Vishṇu the power which preserves, and Śiva the power which destroys:
theogony here commences at the same time with cosmogony. The three
divinities of the Trimúrti govern the phenomena of the universe and influence
all nature. The real God of India is by himself without power; real efficacious
power is attributed only to three divinities who exist externally to him. Brahmá,
Vishṇu, and Śiva, possessed of qualities in part contradictory and attributes
that are mutually exclusive, have no other accord or harmony than that which
results from the power of things itself, and which is found external to their own
thoughts. Such is the Indian Trimúrti. What an immense difference between
this Triad and the wonderful Trinity of Christianity! Here there is only one
God, who created all, provides for all, governs all. He exists in three Persons
equal to one another, and intimately united in one only infinite and eternal
substance. The Father represents the eternal thought and the power which
created, the Son infinite love, the Holy Spirit universal sanctification. This one
and triune God completes by omnipotent power the great work of creation which,
when it has come forth from His hands, proceeds in obedience to the laws which
He has given it, governed with certain order by His infinite providence.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">The immense difference between the Trimúrti of India and the Christian
Trinity is found again between the <hi rend='italic'>avatárs</hi> of Vishṇu and the
Incarnation of Christ. The <hi rend='italic'>avatár</hi> was effected altogether
externally to the Being who is in India regarded as the true God. The manifestation of
one essentially cosmogonical divinity wrought for the most part only material and
cosmogonical prodigies. At one time it takes the form of the gigantic tortoise which
sustains Mount Mandar from sinking in the ocean; at another of the fish which raises the
lost Veda from the bottom of the sea, and saves mankind from the waters. When
these <hi rend='italic'>avatárs</hi> are not cosmogonical they consist in some
protection accorded to
<pb n="526"/><anchor id="Pg526"/>
men or Gods, a protection which is neither universal nor permanent. The very
manner in which the <hi rend='italic'>avatár</hi> is effected corresponds to its material
nature, for instance the mysterious vase and the magic liquor by means of which the
<hi rend='italic'>avatár</hi> here spoken of takes place. What are the forms which Vishṇu
takes in his descents? They are the simple forms of life; he becomes a tortoise, a boar,
a fish, but he is not obliged to take the form of intelligence and liberty, that is to
say, the form of man. In the <hi rend='italic'>avatár</hi> of Vishṇu is discovered the
inpress of pantheistic ideas which have always more or less prevailed in India. Does the
<hi rend='italic'>avatár</hi> produce a permanent and definitive result in the world? By
no means. It is renewed at every catastrophe either of nature or man, and its effects are
only transitory.… To sum up then, the Indian <hi rend='italic'>avatár</hi> is
effected externally to the
true God of India, to Brahma; it has only a cosmogonical or historical mission
which is neither lasting nor decisive; it is accomplished by means of strange
prodigies and magic transformations; it may assume promiscuously all the forms
of life; it may be repeated indefinitely. Now let the whole of this Indian idea
taken from primitive tradition be compared with the Incarnation of Christ and
it will be seen that there is between the two an irreconcilable difference. According
to the doctrines of Christianity the Everlasting Word, Infinite Love, the Son of
God, and equal to Him, assumed a human body, and being born as a man accomplished
by his divine act the great miracle of the spiritual redemption of
man. His coming had for its sole object to bring erring and lost humanity back
to Him; this work being accomplished, and the divine union of men with God
being re-established, redemption is complete and remains eternal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The superficial study of India produced in the last century many erroneous
ideas, many imaginary and false parallels between Christianity and the Brahmanical
religion. A profounder knowledge of Indian civilization and religion,
and philological studies enlarged and guided by more certain principles have
dissipated one by one all those errors. The attributes of the Christian God,
which by one of those intellectual errors, which Vico attributes to the vanity
of the learned, had been transferred to Vishṇu, have by a better inspired philosophy
been reclaimed for Christianity, and the result of the two religions, one
immovable and powerless, the other diffusing itself with all its inherent force
and energy, has shown further that there is a difference, a real opposition, between
the two principles.</q>—<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Gorresio</hi>.

As the story of the banishment of Sítá and the subsequent birth in Válmíki's
hermitage of Kuśa and Lava the rhapsodists of the Rámáyan, is intimately
connected with the account in the introductory cantos of Válmíki's composition
of the poem, I shall, I trust, be pardoned for extracting it from my rough translation
of Kálidása's Raghuvaṇśa, parts only of which have been offered to the
public.
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Then, day by day, the husband's hope grew high,</q></l>
<l>Gazing with love on Sítá's melting eye:</l>
<l>With anxious care he saw her pallid cheek,</l>
<l>And fondly bade her all her wishes speak.</l>
<l><q>Once more I fain would see,</q> the lady cried,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The sacred groves that rise on Gangá's side,</q></l>
<pb n="527"/><anchor id="Pg527"/>
<l>Where holy grass is ever fresh and green,</l>
<l>And cattle feeding on the rice are seen:</l>
<l>There would I rest awhile, where once I strayed</l>
<l><q rend="post">Linked in sweet friendship to each hermit maid.</q></l>
<l>And Ráma smiled upon his wife, and sware,</l>
<l>With many a tender oath, to grant her prayer.</l>
<l>It chanced, one evening, from a lofty seat</l>
<l>He viewed Ayodhyá stretched before his feet:</l>
<l>He looked with pride upon the royal road</l>
<l>Lined with gay shops their glittering stores that showed,</l>
<l>He looked on Sarjú's silver waves, that bore</l>
<l>The light barks flying with the sail and oar;</l>
<l>He saw the gardens near the town that lay,</l>
<l>Filled with glad citizens and boys at play.</l>
<l>Then swelled the monarch's bosom with delight,</l>
<l>And his heart triumphed at the happy sight.</l>
<l>He turned to Bhadra, standing by his side,—</l>
<l>Upon whose secret news the king relied.—</l>
<l>And bade him say what people said and thought</l>
<l>Of all the exploits that his arm had wrought.</l>
<l>The spy was silent, but, when questioned still,</l>
<l>Thus spake, obedient to his master's will:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">For all thy deeds in peace and battle done</q></l>
<l>The people praise thee, King, except for one:</l>
<l>This only act of all thy life they blame,—</l>
<l><q rend="post">Thy welcome home of her, thy ravished dame.</q></l>
<l>Like iron yielding to the iron's blow,</l>
<l>Sank Ráma, smitten by those words of woe.</l>
<l>His breast, where love and fear for empire vied,</l>
<l>Swayed, like a rapid swing, from side to side.</l>
<l>Shall he this rumour scorn, which blots his life,</l>
<l>Or banish her, his dear and spotless wife?</l>
<l>But rigid Duty left no choice between</l>
<l>His perilled honour and his darling queen.</l>
<l>Called to his side, his brothers wept to trace</l>
<l>The marks of anguish in his altered face.</l>
<l>No longer bright and glorious as of old,</l>
<l>He thus addressed them when the tale was told:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Alas! my brothers, that my life should blot</q></l>
<l>The fame of those the Sun himself begot:</l>
<l>As from the labouring cloud the driven rain</l>
<l>Leaves on the mirror's polished face a stain.</l>
<l>E'en as an elephant who loathes the stake</l>
<l>And the strong chain he has no power to break,</l>
<l>I cannot brook this cry on every side,</l>
<l>That spreads like oil upon the moving tide.</l>
<l>I leave the daughter of Videha's King,</l>
<l>And the fair blossom soon from her to spring,</l>
<pb n="528"/><anchor id="Pg528"/>
<l>As erst, obedient to my sire's command,</l>
<l>I left the empire of the sea-girt land.</l>
<l>Good is my queen, and spotless; but the blame</l>
<l>Is hard to bear, the mockery and the shame.</l>
<l>Men blame the pure Moon for the darkened ray,</l>
<l>When the black shadow takes the light away.</l>
<l>And, O my brothers, if ye wish to see</l>
<l>Ráma live long from this reproach set free,</l>
<l>Let not your pity labour to control</l>
<l><q rend="post">The firm sad purpose of his changeless soul.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Ráma spake. The sorrowing brothers heard</l>
<l>His stern resolve, without an answering word;</l>
<l>For none among them dared his voice to raise,</l>
<l>That will to question:—and they could not praise.</l>
<l><q>Beloved brother,</q> thus the monarch cried</l>
<l>To his dear Lakshmaṇ, whom he called aside.—</l>
<l>Lakshmaṇ, who knew no will save his alone</l>
<l>Whose hero deeds through all the world were known:—</l>
<l><q rend="pre">My queen has told me that she longs to rove</q></l>
<l>Beneath the shade of Saint Válmíki's grove:</l>
<l>Now mount thy car, away my lady bear;</l>
<l><q rend="post">Tell all, and leave her in the forest there.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The car was brought, the gentle lady smiled,</l>
<l>As the glad news her trusting heart beguiled.</l>
<l>She mounted up: Sumantra held the reins;</l>
<l>And forth the coursers bounded o'er the plains.</l>
<l>She saw green fields in all their beauty dressed,</l>
<l>And thanked her husband in her loving breast.</l>
<l>Alas! deluded queen! she little knew</l>
<l>How changed was he whom she believed so true;</l>
<l>How one she worshipped like the Heavenly Tree</l>
<l>Could, in a moment's time, so deadly be.</l>
<l>Her right eye throbbed,—ill-omened sign, to tell</l>
<l>The endless loss of him she loved so well,</l>
<l>And to the lady's saddening heart revealed</l>
<l>The woe that Lakshmaṇ, in his love, concealed.</l>
<l>Pale grew the bloom of her sweet face,—as fade</l>
<l>The lotus blossoms,—by that sign dismayed.</l>
<l><q>Oh, may this omen,</q>—was her silent prayer,—</l>
<l><q>No grief to Ráma or his brothers bear!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Lakshmaṇ, faithful to his brother, stood</l>
<l>Prepared to leave her in the distant wood,</l>
<l>The holy Gangá, flowing by the way,</l>
<l>Raised all her hands of waves to bid him stay.</l>
<l>At length with sobs and burning tears that rolled</l>
<l>Down his sad face, the king's command he told;</l>
<l>As when a monstrous cloud, in evil hour,</l>
<pb n="529"/><anchor id="Pg529"/>
<l>Rains from its labouring womb a stony shower.</l>
<l>She heard, she swooned, she fell upon the earth,</l>
<l>Fell on that bosom whence she sprang to birth.</l>
<l>As, when the tempest in its fury flies,</l>
<l>Low in the dust the prostrate creeper lies,</l>
<l>So, struck with terror sank she on the ground,</l>
<l>And all her gems, like flowers, lay scattered round.</l>
<l>But Earth, her mother, closed her stony breast,</l>
<l>And, filled with doubt, denied her daughter rest.</l>
<l>She would not think the Chief of Raghu's race</l>
<l>Would thus his own dear guiltless wife disgrace.</l>
<l>Stunned and unconscious, long the lady lay,</l>
<l>And felt no grief, her senses all astray.</l>
<l>But gentle Lakshmaṇ, with a brother's care,</l>
<l>Brought back her sense, and with her sense, despair.</l>
<l>But not her wrongs, her shame, her grief, could wring</l>
<l>One angry word against her lord the King:</l>
<l>Upon herself alone the blame she laid,</l>
<l>For tears and sighs that would not yet be stayed.</l>
<l>To soothe her anguish Lakshmaṇ gently strove;</l>
<l>He showed the path to Saint Válmíki's grove;</l>
<l>And craved her pardon for the share of ill</l>
<l>He wrought, obedient to his brother's will.</l>
<l><q rend="pre">O, long and happy, dearest brother, live!</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">I have to praise,</q> she cried, <q rend="pre">and not forgive:</q></l>
<l>To do his will should be thy noblest praise;</l>
<l>As Vishṇu ever Indra's will obeys.</l>
<l>Return, dear brother: on each royal dame</l>
<l>Bestow a blessing in poor Sítá's name,</l>
<l>And bid them, in their love, kind pity take</l>
<l>Upon her offspring, for the father's sake.</l>
<l>And speak my message in the monarch's ear,</l>
<l>The last last words of mine that he shall hear:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">Say, was it worthy of thy noble race</q></l>
<l>Thy guiltless queen thus lightly to disgrace?</l>
<l>For idle tales to spurn thy faithful bride,</l>
<l>Whose constant truth the searching fire had tried?</l>
<l>Or may I hope thy soul refused consent,</l>
<l>And but thy voice decreed my banishment?</l>
<l>Hope that no care could turn, no love could stay</l>
<l>The lightning stroke that falls on me to-day?</l>
<l>That sins committed in the life that's fled</l>
<l>Have brought this evil on my guilty head?</l>
<l>Think not I value now my widowed life,</l>
<l>Worthless to her who once was Ráma's wife.</l>
<l>I only live because I hope to see</l>
<l>The dear dear babe that will resemble thee.</l>
<l>And then my task of penance shall be done,</l>
<pb n="530"/><anchor id="Pg530"/>
<l>With eyes uplifted to the scorching sun;</l>
<l>So shall the life that is to come restore</l>
<l><q rend="post">Mine own dear husband, to be lost no more.</q></l>
<l>And Lakshmaṇ swore her every word to tell,</l>
<l>Then turned to go, and bade the queen farewell.</l>
<l>Alone with all her woes, her piteous cries</l>
<l>Rose like a butchered lamb's that struggling dies.</l>
<l>The reverend sage who from his dwelling came</l>
<l>For sacred grass and wood to feed the flame,</l>
<l>Heard her loud shrieks that rent the echoing wood,</l>
<l>And, quickly following, by the mourner stood.</l>
<l>Before the sage the lady bent her low,</l>
<l>Dried her poor eyes, and strove to calm her woe.</l>
<l>With blessings on her hopes the blameless man</l>
<l>In silver tones his soothing speech began:</l>
<l><q rend="pre">First of all faithful wives, O Queen, art thou;</q></l>
<l>And can I fail to mourn thy sorrows now?</l>
<l>Rest in this holy grove, nor harbour fear</l>
<l>Where dwell in safety e'en the timid deer.</l>
<l>Here shall thine offspring safely see the light,</l>
<l>And be partaker of each holy rite.</l>
<l>Here, near the hermits' dwellings, shall thou lave</l>
<l>Thy limbs in Tonse's sin-destroying wave,</l>
<l>And on her isles, by prayer and worship, gain</l>
<l>Sweet peace of mind, and rest from care and pain.</l>
<l>Each hermit maiden with her sweet soft voice,</l>
<l>Shall soothe thy woe, and bid thy heart rejoice:</l>
<l>With fruit and early flowers thy lap shall fill,</l>
<l>And offer grain that springs for us at will.</l>
<l>And here, with labour light, thy task shall be</l>
<l>To water carefully each tender tree,</l>
<l>And learn how sweet a nursing mother's joy</l>
<l><q rend="post">Ere on thy bosom rest thy darling boy.…</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>That very night the banished Sítá bare</l>
<l>Two royal children, most divinely fair.…</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>The saint Válmíki, with a friend's delight,</l>
<l>Graced Sítá's offspring with each holy rite.</l>
<l>Kuśa and Lava—such the names they bore—</l>
<l>Learnt, e'en in childhood, all the Vedas' lore;</l>
<l>And then the bard, their minstrel souls to train,</l>
<l>Taught them to sing his own immortal strain.</l>
<l>And Ráma's deeds her boys so sweetly sang,</l>
<l>That Sítá's breast forgot her bitterest pang.…</l>
</lg>

<pb n="531"/><anchor id="Pg531"/>

<lg>
<l>Then Sítá's children, by the saint's command,</l>
<l>Sang the Rámáyan, wandering through the land.</l>
<l>How could the glorious poem fail to gain</l>
<l>Each heart, each ear that listened to the strain!</l>
<l>So sweet each minstrel's voice who sang the praise</l>
<l>Of Ráma deathless in Válmíki's lays.</l>
<l>Ráma himself amid the wondering throng</l>
<l>Marked their fair forms, and loved the noble song,</l>
<l>While, still and weeping, round the nobles stood,</l>
<l>As, on a windless morn, a dewy wood.</l>
<l>On the two minstrels all the people gazed,</l>
<l>Praised their fair looks and marvelled as they praised;</l>
<l>For every eye amid the throng could trace</l>
<l>Ráma's own image in each youthful face.</l>
<l>Then spoke the king himself and bade them say</l>
<l>Who was their teacher, whose the wondrous lay.</l>
<l>Soon as Válmíki, mighty saint, he saw,</l>
<l>He bowed his head in reverential awe.</l>
<l><q>These are thy children</q> cried the saint, <q rend="pre">recall</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Thine own dear Sítá, pure and true through all.</q></l>
<l><q>O holy father,</q> thus the king replied,</l>
<l><q rend="pre">The faithful lady by the fire was tried;</q></l>
<l>But the foul demon's too successful arts</l>
<l>Raised light suspicions in my people's hearts.</l>
<l>Grant that their breasts may doubt her faith no more,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And thus my Sítá and her sons restore.</q></l>

<p>
<q>He cleared the earth thrice seven times of the Kshatriya caste, and filled
with their blood the five large lakes of Samanta, from which he offered libations
to the race of Bhrigu. Offering a solemn sacrifice to the King of the Gods
Paraśuráma presented the earth to the ministering priests. Having given the
earth to Kaśyapa, the hero of immeasurable prowess retired to the Mahendra
mountain, where he still resides; and in this manner was there enmity between
him and the race of the Kshatriyas, and thus was the whole earth conquered by
Paraśuráma.</q> The destruction of the Kshatriyas by Paraśuráma had been
provoked by the cruelty of the Kshatriyas. <hi rend='italic'>Chips from a German

<p>
The scene in which he appears is probably interpolated for the sake of
making him declare Ráma to be Vishṇu. <q>Herr von Schlegel has often remarked
to me,</q> says Lassen, <q>that without injuring the connexion of the story all
the chapters [of the Rámáyan] might be omitted in which Ráma is regarded as
an incarnation of Vishṇu. In fact, where the incarnation of Vishṇu as the four
sons of Daśaratha is described, the great sacrifice is already ended, and all the
priests remunerated at the termination, when the new sacrifice begins at which
the Gods appear, then withdraw, and then first propose the incarnation to Vishṇu.
<pb n="532"/><anchor id="Pg532"/>
If it had been an original circumstance of the story, the Gods would certainly
have deliberated on the matter earlier, and the celebration of the sacrifice would
have continued without interruption.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Lassen</hi>,

<p>
<q>The idea of fate was different in India from that which prevailed in
Greece. In Greece fate was a mysterious, inexorable power which governed
men and human events, and from which it was impossible to escape. In India
Fate was rather an inevitable consequence of actions done in births antecedent
to one's present state of existence, and was therefore connected with the doctrine
of metempsychosis. A misfortune was for the most part a punishment, an expiation
of ancient faults not yet entirely cancelled.</q> <hi

<p>
<q>Though of royal extraction, Viśvámitra conquered for himself and his
family the privileges of a Brahman. He became a Brahman, and thus broke
through all the rules of caste. The Brahmans cannot deny the fact, because it
forms one of the principal subjects of their legendary poems. But they have
spared no pains to represent the exertions of Viśvámitra, in his struggle for
Brahmanhood, as so superhuman that no one would easily be tempted to follow
his example. No mention is made of these monstrous penances in the Veda,
where the struggle between Viśvámitra, the leader of the Kuśikas or Bharatas,
and the Brahman Vaśishtha, the leader of the white-robed Tritsus, is represented
as the struggle of two rivals for the place of Purohita or chief priest and minister
at the court of King Sudás, the son of Pijavana.</q>

<head>Household Gods, Page 102.</head>

<p>
<q rend="pre">No house is supposed to be without its tutelary divinity, but the notion
attached to this character is now very far from precise. The deity who is the
object of hereditary and family worship, the <hi rend='italic'>Kuladevatá</hi>, is always
one of the leading personages of the Hindu mythology, as Śiva, Vishṇu or Durgá, but the
<hi rend='italic'>Grihadevatá</hi> rarely bears any distinct appellation. In Bengal, the
domestic god is sometimes the <hi rend='italic'>Sálagrám</hi> stone,
sometimes the <hi rend='italic'>tulasi</hi> plant, sometimes a
basket with a little rice in it, and sometimes a water-jar—to either of which a
brief adoration is daily addressed, most usually by the females of the family.
Occasionally small images of Lakshmi or Chaṇdi fulfil the office, or should a
snake appear, he is venerated as the guardian of the dwelling. In general,
however, in former times, the household deities were regarded as the unseen
spirits of ill, the ghosts and goblins who hovered about every spot, and claimed
some particular sites as their own. Offerings were made to them in the open air,
by scattering a little rice with a short formula at the close of all ceremonies to
keep them in good humour.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The household gods correspond better with the genii locorum than with the
lares or penates of autiquity.</q>

<p>
<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">The Suppliant Dove.</hi>
</p>

<lg>
<l>Chased by a hawk there came a dove</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With worn and weary wing,</l>
<l>And took her stand upon the hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of Káśí's mighty king.</l>
<l>The monarch smoothed her ruffled plumes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And laid her on his breast,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Came swooping down the wind:</l>
<l><q>This bird,</q> he cried, <q rend="pre">my destined prize,</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not for thee to shield:</l>
<l>'Tis mine by right and toilsome flight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er hill and dale and field.</l>
<l>Hunger and thirst oppress me sore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And I am faint with toil:</l>

<l>He carved the flesh from off his side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And threw it in the scale,</l>
<l>While women's cries smote on the skies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With loud lament and wail.</l>
<l>He hacked the flesh from side and arm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From chest and back and thigh,</l>
<l>But still above the little dove</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch's scale stood high.</l>
<l>He heaped the scale with piles of flesh,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With sinews, blood and skin,</l>
<l>And when alone was left him bone</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He threw himself therein.</l>
<l>Then thundered voices through the air;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sky grew black as night;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To see that wondrous sight.</l>
<l>The blessed Gods, from every sphere,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Indra led, came nigh:</l>

<hi rend='italic'>Vaśishṭha</hi> and the other Bráhmanas in the same manner as Indra by
the Vasus … and the observation which is made in some passages that a certain rite of
the inauguration was performed <q>according to the sacred rule</q> … admit of the
conclusion that the ceremony was supposed to have taken place in conformity with the
vaidik injunction.… As the inauguration of <hi rend='italic'>Ráma</hi> was intended
and the necessary preparations for it were made when his father Daśaratha was still
alive, but as the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his step-mother
<hi rend='italic'>Kaikeyí</hi>, did not take place then, but fourteen years later, after
the death of <hi rend='italic'>Daśaratha</hi>, an account of the preparatory ceremonies
is given in the <hi rend='italic'>Ayodhyákáṇḍa</hi> (Book II) as well as in the
<hi rend='italic'>Yuddha-Káṇḍa</hi> (Book VI.) of the Rámáyaṇa, but an account of the
complete ceremony in the latter book alone. According to the
<hi rend='italic'>Ayodhyákáṇḍa</hi>, on the day preceding the intended inauguration
<hi rend='italic'>Ráma</hi> and his wife <hi rend='italic'>Sítá</hi> held a fast, and in
the night they performed this preliminary rite: <hi rend='italic'>Ráma</hi> having made
his ablutions, approached the idol of <hi rend='italic'>Náráyaṇa</hi>, took a cup of
clarified butter, as the religious law prescribes, made a libation of it into the kindled
fire, and drank the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to his heart. Then, with
his mind fixed on the divinity he lay, silent and composed, together with <hi
rend='italic'>Sítá</hi>, on a bed of Kuśa-grass, which was spread before the altar of
Vishṇu, until the last watch of the night, when he awoke and ordered the palace to be
prepared for the solemnity. At day-break reminded of the time by the voices of the bards,
he performed the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity. In the meantime the
town Ayodhyá had assumed a festive appearance and the inauguration implements had been
arranged … golden water-jars, an ornamented throne-seat, a chariot covered with a
splendid tiger-skin, water taken from the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as
from other sacred rivers, tanks, wells, lakes, and from all oceans, honey, curd,
clarified butter, fried grain, Kuśa-grass, flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful
damsels, and a splendid furious elephant, golden and silver jars, filled with water,
covered with <hi rend='italic'>Udumbara</hi> branches and various lotus flowers, besides
a white jewelled <hi rend='italic'>chourie</hi>, a white splendid parasol, a white bull,
a white horse, all manner of musical instruments and bards.… In the preceding
chapter … there are mentioned <hi rend='italic'>two</hi> white <hi
rend='italic'>chouries</hi> instead of one, and all kinds of seeds, perfumes and jewels,
a scimitar, a bow, a litter, a golden vase, and a blazing fire, and amongst the
living implements of the pageant, instead of the bards, gaudy courtesans, and
besides the eight damsels, professors of divinity, Bráhmaṇas, cows and pure
kinds of wild beasts and birds, the chiefs of town and country-people and the
citizens with their train.</q>

</lg>

<p>
<q>Mythology regards Vritra as a demon or Asur, the implacable enemy of
Indra, but this is not the primitive idea contained in the name of Vritra. In
the hymns of the Veda Vritra appears to be the thick dark cloud which Indra
the God of the firmament attacks and disperses with his thunderbolt.</q>
<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Gorresio.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q>In that class of Rig-veda hymns which there is reason to look upon as
the oldest portion of Vedic poetry, the character of Indra is that of a mighty
ruler of the firmament, and his principal feat is that of conquering the demon
<hi rend='italic'>Vritra</hi>, a symbolical personification of the cloud which
obstructs the clearness of the sky, and withholds the fructifying rain from the earth.
In his battles with Vritra he is therefore described as <q>opening the receptacles of
the waters,</q> as <q>cleaving the cloud</q> with his <q>far-whirling thunderbolt,</q>
as <q>casting the waters down to earth,</q> and <q>restoring the sun to the sky.</q>
He is in consequence <q>the upholder of heaven, earth, and firmament,</q> and the god
<q>who has engendered the sun and the dawn.</q></q>
<hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Chambers's Cyclopædia</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Indra</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>Throughout these hymns two images stand out before us with overpowering
distinctness. On one side is the bright god of the heaven, as beneficent as
he is irresistible: on the other the demon of night and of darkness, as false and
treachorous as he is malignant.… The latter (as his name Vritra, from var, to
veil, indicates) is pre-eminently the thief who hides away the rain-clouds.… But
the myth is yet in too early a state to allow of the definite designations which are
brought before us in the conflicts of Zeus with Typhôn and his monstrous
progeny, of Apollôn with the Pythôn, of Bellerophôn with Chimaira of Oidipous
with the Sphinx, of Hercules with Cacus, of Sigurd with the dragon Fafnir; and
thus not only is Vritra known by many names, but he is opposed sometimes by
Indra, sometimes by Agni the fire-god, sometimes by Trita, Brihaspati, or other
deities; or rather these are all names of one and the same god.</q>

<l><hi rend='italic'>Who of Nisháda lineage came.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
The following account of the origin of the Nishádas is taken from Wilson's
<hi rend='italic'>Vishṇu Puráṇa</hi>, Book I. Chap. 15. <q>Afterwards the Munis beheld a
great dust arise, and they said to the people who were nigh: <q>What is this?</q> And the
people answered and said: <q>Now that the kingdom is without a king, the dishonest
men have begun to seize the property of their neighbours. The great
dust that you behold, excellent Munis, is raised by troops of clustering robbers,
hastening to fall upon their prey.</q> The sages, hearing this, consulted, and
together rubbed the thigh of the king (Vena), who had left no offspring, to
produce a son. From the thigh, thus rubbed, came forth a being of the complexion
of a charred stake, with flattened features like a negro, and of dwarfish
stature. <q>What am I to do,</q> cried he eagerly to the Munis. <q>Sit down
(nishída),</q> said they. And thence his name was Nisháda. His descendants, the
inhabitants of the Vindhyá mountain, great Muni, are still called Nishádas and are
characterized by the exterior tokens of depravity.</q> Professor Wilson adds, in his
note on the passage: <q>The Matsya says that there were born outcast or barbarous races,
Mlechchhas, as black as collyrium. The Bhágavata describes an individual of
dwarfish stature, with short arms and legs, of a complexion as black as a crow,
with projecting chin, broad flat nose, red eyes, and tawny hair, whose descendants
were mountaineers and foresters. The Padma (Bhúmi Khaṇḍa) has a
similar deccription; adding to the dwarfish stature and black complexion, a
wide mouth, large ears, and a protuberant belly. It also particularizes his posterity
as Nishádas, Kirátas, Bhillas, and other barbarians and Mlechchhas, living
in woods and on mountains. These passages intend, and do not much exaggerate,
the uncouth appearance of the Gonds, Koles, Bhils, and other uncivilized tribes,
scattered along the forests and mountains of Central India from Behar to Khandesh,
and who are, not improbably, the predecessors of the present occupants of
the cultivated portions of the country. They are always very black, ill-shapen,
and dwarfish, and have countenances of a very African character.</q>

<q>The punishment which the Code of Manu awards to the slayer of a

of killing Brahmans; but in allowing a hermit who was not a

the Code. The youth in the poem is allowed to read the Veda, and to accumulate merit by

<head>Page 178. Bharat's Return.</head>

<p>
<q>Two routes from Ayodhyá to Rájagriha or Girivraja are described. That
taken by the envoys appears to have been the shorter one, and we are not told
why Bharat returned by a different road. The capital of the Kekayas lay to the
west of the Vipáśá. Between it and the Śatadru stretched the country of the
Báhíkas. Upon the remaining portion of the road the two recensions differ.
According to that of Bengal there follow towards the east the river Indamatí,
then the town Ajakála belonging to the Bodhi, then Bhulingá, then the river
Śaradaṇḍá. According to the other instead of the first river comes the Ikshumatí …
instead of the first town Abhikála, instead of the second Kulingá, then
the second river. According to the direction of the route both the above-mentioned
rivers must be tributaries of the Śatadrú.… The road then crossed the
Yamuná (Jumna), led beyond that river through the country of the Panchálas, and
reached the Ganges at Hástinapura, where the ferry was. Thence it led over the
Rámagangá and its eastern tributaries, then over the Gomati, and then in a
southern direction along the Málini, beyond which it reached Ayodhyá. In
Bharat's journey the following rivers are passed from west to east: <hi
rend='italic'>Kutikoshṭiká</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Uttániká</hi>, <hi
rend='italic'>Kuṭiká</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Kapívatí</hi>, <hi

<hi rend='italic'>Uttáriká</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Kuṭilá</hi>, <hi
rend='italic'>Kapívatí</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Gomatí</hi> according to Gorresio. As
these rivers are to be looked for on the east of the Ganges, the first must be the
modern <hi rend='italic'>Koh</hi>, a small affluent of the Rámagangá, over which the
highway cannot have gone as it bends too far to the north. The Uttániká or Uttáriká must
be the Rámagangá, the Kuṭiká or Kuṭilá its eastern tributary, Kośilá, the Kapívatí the
next tributary which on the maps has different names, <hi rend='italic'>Gurra</hi> or

<q rend="pre">The narrative of Ráma's exile in the jungle is one of the most obscure
portions of the Rámáyana, inasmuch as it is difficult to discover any trace of the
original tradition, or any illustration of actual life and manners, beyond the
artificial life of self-mortification and selfdenial said to have been led by the
Brahman sages of olden time. At the same time, however, the story throws some
light upon the significance of the poem, and upon the character in which the
Brahmanical author desired to represent Ráma; and consequently it deserves
more serious consideration than the nature of the subject-matter would otherwise
seem to imply.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>According to the Rámáyana, the hero Ráma spent more than thirteen
years of his exile in wandering amongst the different Brahmanical settlements,
which appear to have been scattered over the country between the Ganges and
the Godáveri; his wanderings extending from the hill of Chitra-kúṭa in Bundelkund,
to the modern town of Nasik on the western side of India, near the source
of the Godáveri river, and about seventy-five miles to the north-west of Bombay.
The appearance of these Brahmanical hermitages in the country far away to the
south of the Raj of Kasala, seems to call for critical inquiry. Each hermitage is
said to have belonged to some particular sage, who is famous in Brahmanical
tradition. But whether the sages named were really contemporaries of Ráma, or
whether they could possibly have flourished at one and the same period, is open
to serious question. It is of course impossible to fix with any degree of certainty
the relative chronology of the several sages, who are said to have been visited by
Ráma; but still it seems tolerably clear that some belonged to an age far anterior
to that in which the Rámáyana was composed, and probably to an age anterior
to that in which Ráma existed as a real and living personage; whilst, at
least, one sage is to be found who could only have existed in the age during
which the Rámáyana was produced in its present form. The main proofs of these
inferences are as follows. An interval of many centuries seems to have elapsed
between the composition of the Rig-Veda and that of the Rámáyana: a conclusion
<pb n="542"/><anchor id="Pg542"/>
which has long been proved by the evidence of language, and is generally accepted
by Sanskrit scholars. But three of the sages, said to have been contemporary
with Ráma, namely, Viśvámitra, Atri and Agastya, are frequently mentioned in
the hymns of the Rig-Veda; whilst Válmíki, the sage dwelling at Chitra-kúṭa,
is said to have been himself the composer of the Rámáyana. Again, the sage Atri,
whom Ráma visited immediately after his departure from Chitra-kúṭa, appears
in the genealogical list preserved in the Mahá Bhárata, as the progenitor of the
Moon, and consequently as the first ancestor of the Lunar race: whilst his grandson
Buddha [Budha] is said to have married Ilá, the daughter of Ikhsváku
who was himself the remote ancestor of the Solar race of Ayodhyá, from whom
Ráma was removed by many generations. These conclusions are not perhaps based
upon absolute proof, because they are drawn from untrustworthy authorities;
but still the chronological difficulties have been fully apprehended by the Pundits,
and an attempt has been made to reconcile all contradictions by representing
the sages to have lived thousands of years, and to have often re-appeared upon
earth in different ages widely removed from each other. Modern science refuses
to accept such explanations; and consequently it is impossible to escape the conclusion
that if Válmíki composed the Rámáyana in the form of Sanskrit in which
it has been preserved, he could not have flourished in the same age as the sages
who are named in the Rig-Veda.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Wheeler's</hi>

<head>Page 286. Urvasí.</head>

<p>
<q>The personification of Urvasî herself is as thin as that of Eôs or Selênê.
Her name is often found in the Veda as a mere name for the morning, and in the
plural number it is used to denote the dawns which passing over men bring them
to old age and death. Urvasî is the bright flush of light overspreading the heaven
before the sun rises, and is but another form of the many mythical beings of
Greek mythology whose names take us back to the same idea or the same root.
As the dawn in the Vedic hymns is called Urûkî, the far-going (Têlephassa, Têlephos),
so is she also Uruasî, the wide-existing or wide-spreading; as are Eurôpê,
Euryanassa, Euryphassa, and many more of the sisters of Athênê and Aphroditê.
As such she is the mother of Vasishtha, the bright being, as Oidipous is the son
of Iokastê; and although Vasishtha, like Oidipous, has become a mortal bard or
sage, he is still the son of Mitra and Varuṇa, of night and day. Her lover Purûravas
is the counterpart of the Hellenic Polydeukês; but the continuance of her
union with him depends on the condition that she never sees him unclothed. But
the Gandharvas, impatient of her long sojourn among mortal men resolved to
bring her back to their bright home; and Purûravas is thus led unwitingly to disregard
her warning. A ewe with two lambs was tied to her couch, and the Gandharvas
stole one of them; Urvasî said, <q>They take away my darling, as if I lived in a
land where there is no hero and no man.</q> They stole the second, and she upbraided
her husband again. Then Purûravas looked and said, <q>How can that be a land
without heroes or men where I am?</q> And naked he sprang up; he thought it
was too long to put on his dress. Then the Gandharvas sent a flash of lighting,
and Urvasî saw her husband naked as by daylight. Then she vanished. <q>I come
back,</q> she said, and went. <q>Then he bewailed his vanished love in bitter grief.</q>
Her promise to return was fulfilled, but for a moment only, at the Lotos-lake,
and Purûravas in vain beseeches her to tarry longer. <q>What shall I do with thy
<pb n="545"/><anchor id="Pg545"/>
speech?</q> is the answer of Urvasî. <q>I am gone like the first of the dawns. Purûravas,
go home again. I am hard to be caught like the winds.</q> Her lover is in utter
despair; but when he lies down to die, the heart of Urvasî was melted, and she
bids him come to her on the last night of the year. On that night only he might
be with her; but a son should be born to him. On that day he went up to the
golden seats, and there Urvasî told him that the Gandharvas would grant him
one wish, and that he must make his choice. <q>Choose thou for me,</q> he said: and
she answered, <q>Say to them, Let me be one of you.</q></q>

<head>Page 329. Ráma's Alliance With Sugríva.</head>

<p>
<q rend="pre">The literal interpretation of this portion of the Rámáyana is indeed deeply
rooted in the mind of the Hindu. He implicitly believes that Ráma is Vishnu,
who became incarnate for the purpose of destroying the demon Rávana: that he
permitted his wife to be captured by Rávana for the sake of delivering the gods
and Bráhmans from the oppressions of the Rákshasa; and that he ultimately
assembled an army of monkeys, who were the progeny of the gods, and led them
against the strong-hold of Rávana at Lanká, and delivered the world from the
tyrant Rákshasa, whilst obtaining ample revenge for his own personal wrongs.</q>
</p>

<pb n="546"/><anchor id="Pg546"/>

<p>
One other point seems to demand consideration, namely, the possibility of
such an alliance as that which Ráma is said to have concluded with the monkeys.
This possibility will of course be denied by modern critics, but still it is interesting
to trace out the circumstances which seem to have led to the acceptance of such a
wild belief by the dreamy and marvel loving Hindi. The south of India swarms
with monkeys of curious intelligence and rare physical powers. Their wonderful
instinct for organization, their attachment to particular localities, their occasional
journeys in large numbers over mountains and across rivers, their obstinate
assertion of supposed rights, and the ridiculous caricature which they exhibit of
all that is animal and emotional in man, would naturally create a deep impression.…
Indeed the habits of monkeys well deserve to be patiently studied;
not as they appear in confinement, when much that is revolting in their nature is
developed, but as they appear living in freedom amongst the trees of the forest,
or in the streets of crowded cities, or precincts of temples. Such a study would
not fail to awaken strange ideas; and although the European would not be prepared
to regard monkeys as sacred animals he might be led to speculate as to their
origin by the light of data, which are at present unknown to the naturalist whose
observations have been derived from the menagerie alone.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post">Whatever, however, may have been the train of ideas which led the Hindú
to regard the monkey as a being half human and half divine, there can be little
doubt that in the Rámáyana the monkeys of southern India have been confounded
with what may be called the aboriginal people of the country. The origin of
this confusion may be easily conjectured. Perchance the aborigines of the country
may have been regarded as a superior kind of monkeys; and to this day the features
of the Marawars, who are supposed to be the aborigines of the southern
part of the Carnatic, are not only different from those of their neighbours, but
are of a character calculated to confirm the conjecture. Again, it is probable
that the army of aborigines may have been accompanied by outlying bands of
monkeys impelled by that magpie-like curiosity and love of plunder which are
the peculiar characteristics of the monkey race; and this incident may have
given rise to the story that the army was composed of Monkeys.</q>

<head>Page 342. The Fall Of Báli.</head>

<p>
<q>As regards the narrative, it certainly seems to refer to some real event
amongst the aboriginal tribes: namely, the quarrel between an elder and younger
brother for the possession of a Ráj; and the subsequent alliance of Ráma with
the younger brother. It is somewhat remarkable that Ráma appears to have
formed an alliance with the wrong party, for the right of Báli was evidently
superior to that of Sugríva; and it is especially worthy of note that Ráma compassed
the death of Báli by an act contrary to all the laws of fair fighting. Again,
Ráma seems to have tacitly sanctioned the transfer of Tárá from Báli to Sugríva,
which was directly opposed to modern rule, although in conformity with the
rude customs of a barbarous age; and it is remarkable that to this day the
marriage of both widows and divorced women is practised by the Marawars, or
aborigines of the southern Carnatic, contrary to the deeply-rooted prejudice
which exists against such unions amongst the Hindús at large.</q>

<head>Page 370. The Vánar Host.</head>

<p>
<q rend="pre">The splendid Marutas form the army of Indras, the red-haired monkeys
and bears that of Râmas; and the mythical and solar nature of the monkeys
and bears of the Râmâyaṇam manifests itself several times. The king of the
monkeys is a sun-god. The ancient king was named Bâlin, and was the son of
Indras. His younger brother Sugrívas, he who changes his shape at pleasure
(Kâmarúpas), who, helped by Râmas, usurped his throne, is said to be own child
of the sun. Here it is evident that the Vedic antagonism between Indras and
Vishṇus is reproduced in a zoological and entirely apish form. The old Zeus must
give way to the new, the moon to the sun, the evening to the morning sun, the
sun of winter to that of spring; the young son betrays and overthrows the old
one.… Râmas, who treacherously kills the old king of the monkeys, Bâlin, is
the equivalent of Vishṇus, who hurls his predecessor Indras from his throne;
and Sugrívas, the new king of the monkeys resembles Indras when he promises
to find the ravished Sítá, in the same way as Vishṇus in one of his incarnations
finds again the lost vedás. And there are other indications in the Râmâyaṇam
of opposition between Indras and the monkeys who assist Râmas. The great
monkey Hanumant, of the reddish colour of gold, has his jaw broken, Indras
having struck him with his thunderbolt and caused him to fall upon a mountain,
because, while yet a child, he threw himself off a mountain into the air in order to
arrest the course of the sun, whose rays had no effect upon him. (The cloud rises
from the mountain and hides the sun, which is unable of itself to disperse it;
the tempest comes, and brings flashes of lightning and thunder-bolts, which tear
the cloud in pieces.)</q>
</p>

<p>
The whole legend of the monkey Hanumant represents the sun entering
into the cloud or darkness, and coming out of it. His father is said to be now
the wind, now the elephant of the monkeys (Kapikunjaras), now Keśarin, the
long-haired sun, the sun with a mane, the lion sun (whence his name of
<hi rend='italic'>Keśariṇah putrah</hi>). From this point of view, Hanumant would seem
to be the brother of Sugrívas, who is also the offspring of the sun.…
</p>

<p>
All the epic monkeys of the <hi rend='italic'>Râmâyaṇam</hi> are described in the
twentieth canto of the first book by expressions which very closely resemble those
applied in the Vedic hymns to the Marutas, as swift as the tempestuous wind, changing
their shape at pleasure, making a noise like clouds, sounding like thunder,
battling, hurling mountain-peaks, shaking great uprooted trees, stirring up the
deep waters, crushing the earth with their arms, making the clouds fall. Thus
Bâlin comes out of the cavern as the sun out of the cloud.…
</p>

<p>
But the legend of the monkey Hanumant presents another curious resemblance
to that of Samson. Hanumant is bound with cords by Indrajit, son of
Rávaṇas; he could easily free himself, but does not wish to do so. Rávaṇas to
put him to shame, orders his tail to be burned, because the tail is the part most
prized by monkeys.…
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post">The tail of Hanumant, which sets fire to the city of the monsters, is
probably a personification of the rays of the morning or spring sun, which sets fire to
the eastern heavens, and destroys the abode of the nocturnal or winter monsters.</q>

<q>The Jaitwas of Rajputana, a tribe politically reckoned as Rajputs, nevertheless
trace their descent from the monkey-god Hanuman, and confirm it by

<head>Page 378. Northern Kurus.</head>

<p>
Professor Lassen remarks in the Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes,
ii. 62: <q>At the furthest accessible extremity of the earth appears
Harivarsha with the northern Kurus. The region of Hari or Vishṇu belongs to
the system of mythical geography; but the case is different with the Uttara
Kurus. Here there is a real basis of geographical fact; of which fable has only
taken advantage, without creating it. The Uttara Kurus were formerly quite independent
of the mythical system of <hi rend='italic'>dvípas</hi>, though they were included in
it at an early date.</q> Again the same writer says at p. 65: <q rend="pre">That the
conception of the Uttara Kurus is based upon an actual country and not on mere invention,
is proved (1) by the way in which they are mentioned in the Vedas; (2) by the
<pb n="551"/><anchor id="Pg551"/>
existence of Uttara Kuru in historical times as a real country; and (3) by the
way in which the legend makes mention of that region as the home of primitive
customs. To begin with the last point the Mahábhárata speaks as follows of the
freer mode of life which women led in the early world, Book I. verses 4719-22:
<q>Women were formerly unconfined and roved about at their pleasure, independent.
Though in their youthful innocence they abandoned their husbands, they
were guilty of no offence; for such was the rule in early times. This ancient
custom is even now the law for creatures born as brutes, which are free from lust
and anger. This custom is supported by authority and is observed by great rishis,
and it is <hi rend='italic'>still practiced among the northern Kurus</hi>.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">The idea which is here conveyed is that of the continuance in one part of
the world of that original blessedness which prevailed in the golden age. To
afford a conception of the happy condition of the southern Kurus it is said in
another place (M.-Bh, i. 4346.) <q>The southern Kurus vied in happiness with the
northern Kurus and with the divine rishis and bards.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post">Professor Lassen goes on to say: <q>Ptolemy (vi. 16.) is also acquainted
with <hi rend='italic'>Uttara Kuru</hi>. He speaks of a mountain, a people, and a city
called <hi rend='italic'>Ottorakorra</hi>. Most of the other ancient authors who
elsewhere mention this name, have it from him. It is a part of the country which he
calls Serica; according to him the city lies twelve degrees west from the metropolis of
Sera, and the mountain extends from thence far to the eastward. As Ptolemy has misplaced
the whole of eastern Asia beyond the Ganges, the <hi rend='italic'>relative</hi>
position which he assigns will guide us better that the absolute one, which removes
<hi rend='italic'>Ottorakorra</hi> so far to the east that a correction is inevitable.
According to my opinion the <hi rend='italic'>Ottorakorra</hi> of Ptolemy must be sought
for to the east of Kashgar.</q> Lassen also thinks that Magasthenes had the Uttara Kurus
in view when he referred to the Hyperboreans who were fabled by Indian writers to live a
thousand years. In his Indian antiquities, (Ind. Alterthumskunde, i. 511, 512. and note,)
the same writer concludes that though the passages above cited relative to the Uttara
Kurus indicate a belief in the existence of a really existing country of that name in the
far north, yet that the descriptions there given are to be taken as pictures of an ideal
paradise, and not as founded on any recollections of the northern origin of the
Kurus. It is probable, he thinks, that some such reminiscences originally existed,
and still survived in the Vedic era, though there is no trace of their existence in
latter times.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Muir's</hi> <hi

and combined the heroical character with their atmospherical deity. Under this

<q>The Muni or saint Agastya, author of several Vedic hymns, was celebrated
in Indo-Sanskrit tradition for having directed the first brahmanical settlements
in the southern regions of India; and the Mahábhárata gives him the
credit of having subjected those countries, expelled the Rákshases. and given
security to the solitary ascetics, who were settled there. Hence Agastya was
regarded in ancient legend as the conqueror and ruler of the southern country.
This tradition refers to the earliest migrations made by the Sanskrit Indians
towards the south of India. To Agastya are attributed many marvellous mythic
deeds which adumbrate and veil ancient events; some of which are alluded to
here and there in the Rámáyana.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Gorresio.</hi>

Having found Ráma weary with fighting and buried in deep thought,

who had come to see the battle, approached Ráma and spoke to him thus:
<q rend="pre">O mighty Ráma, listen to the old mystery by which thou wilt conquer all thy
foes in the battle. Having daily repeated the Ádityahridaya (the delighter
of the mind of the Sun) the holy prayer which destroys all enemies (of him who
repeats it) gives victory, removes all sins, sorrows and distress, increases life,
and which is the blessing of all blessings, worship the rising and splendid sun
who is respected by both the Gods and demons, who gives light to all bodies and
who is the rich lord of all the worlds, (To the question why this prayer claims so
great reverence; the sage answers) Since yonder<note place="foot">From the word yonder
it would appear that the prayer is to be repeated at the rising of the Sun.</note>
sun is full of glory and all gods reside in him (he being their material cause) and
bestows being and the active principle on all creatures by his rays; and since he
protects all deities, demons and men with his rays.</q>

<p>
<q>In the funeral ceremonies of India the fire was placed on three sides of the
pyre; the <hi rend='italic'>Dakshiṇa</hi> on the south, the <hi
rend='italic'>Gárhapatya</hi> on the west, and the <hi rend='italic'>Áhavaníya</hi>
on the east. The funeral rites are not described in detail here, and it is therefore
difficult to elucidate and explain them. The poem assigns the funeral ceremonies
of Aryan Brahmans to the Rákshases, a race different from them in origin and
religion, in the same way as Homer sometimes introduces into Troy the rites of
the Grecian cult.</q> <hi rend="font-variant: small-caps">Gorresio.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Muir translates the description of the funeral from the Calcutta edition,
as follows: <q>They formed, with Vedic rites, a funeral pile of faggots of sandal-wood,
with <hi rend='italic'>padmaka</hi> wood, <hi rend='italic'>uśira</hi> grass, and
sandal, and covered with a quilt of deer's hair. They then performed an unrivalled
obsequial ceremony for the Ráxasa prince, placing the sacrificial ground to
the S.E. and the fire in the proper situation. They cast the ladle filled
with curds and ghee on the shoulder<note place="foot">According to Ápastamba (says the
commentator) <q>it should have been placed on the nose: this must therefore have been
done in conformity with some other Sútras.</q></note> of the deceased; he
(?) placed the car on the feet, and the mortar between the thighs. Having
deposited all the wooden vessels, the [upper] and lower fire-wood, and the
other pestle, in their proper places, they departed. The Ráxasas having then slain
a victim to their prince in the manner prescribed in the Śástras, and enjoined by
great rishis, cast [into the fire] the coverlet of the king saturated with ghee. They
then, Vibhíshaṇa included, with afflicted hearts, adorned Rávaṇa with perfumes
and garlands, and with various vestments, and besprinkled him with fried grain.
Vibhíshaṇa having bathed, and having, with his clothes wet, scattered in proper
form <hi rend='italic'>tila</hi> seeds mixed with <hi rend='italic'>darbha</hi>
grass, and moistened with water, applied the fire [to the pile].</q>

The following is a literal translation of Brahmá's address to Ráma according
to the Calcutta edition, text and commentary:
</p>

<p>
<q>O Ráma, how dost thou, being the creator of all the world, best of all
those who have profound knowledge of the Upanishads and all-powerful as thou
art, suffer Sítá to fall in the fire? How dost thou not know thyself as the best
of the gods? Thou art one of the primeval Vasus,<note place="foot">A class of eight
gods.</note> and also their lord and creator. Thou art thyself the lord and
first creator of the three worlds. Thou art the eighth (that is Mahádeva) of
the Rudras,<note place="foot">A class of eleven gods called Rudras.</note> and also the
fifth<note place="foot">Named Víryaván.</note> of the Sádhyas.<note place="foot">A
class of divine devotees named Sádhyas.</note>
(The poet describes Ráma as made of the following gods) The Aśvinikumáras
(the twin divine physicians of the gods) are thy ears; the sun and the moon are thy
eyes; and thou hast been seen in the beginning and at the end of creation. How
dost thou neglect the daughter of Videha (Janaka} like a man whose actions are
directed by the dictates of nature?</q> Thus addressed by Indra, Brahmá and
<pb n="559"/><anchor id="Pg559"/>
the other gods, Ráma the descendant of Raghu, lord of the world and the best of
the virtuous, spoke to the chief of the gods. <q>As I take myself to be a man of
the name of Ráma and son of Daśaratha, therefore, sir, please tell me who I am
and whence have I come.</q> <q>O thou whose might is never failing,</q> said Brahmá
to Kákutstha the foremost of those who thoroughly know Brahmá, <q>Thou art
Náráyaṇa,<note place="foot">One who resides in the water.</note> almighty, possessed
of fortune, and armed with the discus. Thou art the boar<note place="foot">The third
incarnation of Vishṇu, that bore the earth on his tusk.</note> with one tusk; the
conqueror of thy past and future foes. Thou art Brahmá true and eternal or undecaying.
Thou art Viśvaksena,<note place="foot">One whose armies are everywhere.</note> having
four arms; Thou art Hrishíkeśa,<note place="foot">One who controls the senses.</note>
whose bow is made of horn; Thou art Purusha,<note place="foot">He who resides in the
heart, or who is full, or all-pervading.</note> the best of all beings; Thou art one who
is never defeated by any body; Thou art the holder of the sword (named Nandaka). Thou art
Vishṇu (the pervader of all); blue in colour: of great might; the commander of armies;
and lord of villages. Thou art truth. Thou art embodied intelligence, forgiveness,
control over the senses, creation, and destruction. Thou art Upendra<note
place="foot">Vámana, or the Dwarf incarnation of Vishṇu.</note> and Madhusúdana.<note
place="foot">The killer of Madhu, a demon.</note> Thou art the creator of Indra, the
ruler over all the world, Padmanábha,<note place="foot">He from whose navel, the lotus,
from which Brahmá was born, springs.</note> and destroyer of enemies in the battle. The
divine Rishis call thee shelter of refugees, as well as the giver of shelter. Thou hast a
thousand horns,<note place="foot">He who has a thousand horns. The horns are here the
Sákhás of the Sáma-veda.</note> a hundred heads.<note place="foot">One who has a hundred
heads. The heads are here meant to devote a hundred commandments of the Vedas.</note>
Thou art respected of the respected; and the lord and first creator of the three worlds.
Thou art the forefather and shelter of Siddhas,<note place="foot">Siddhas are those who
have already gained the summit of their desires.</note> and Sádhyas.<note
place="foot">Sádhyas are those that are still trying to gain the summit.</note> Thou art
sacrifices; Vashaṭkára,<note place="foot">A mystic syllable uttered in Mantras.</note>
Omkára.<note place="foot">A mystic syllable made of the letters which respectively denote
Brahmá, Vishṇu, and Śiva.</note> Thou art beyond those who are beyond our senses.
There is none who knows who thou art and who knows thy beginning and end.
Thou art seen in all material objects, in Bráhmans, in cows, and also in all the
quarters, sky and streams. Thou hast a thousand feet, a hundred heads, and a
thousand eyes. Thou hast borne the material objects and the earth with the
mountains; and at the bottom of the ocean thou art seen the great serpent. O
Ráma, Thou hast borne the three worlds, gods, Gandharvas,<note place="foot">A class of
divine gods.</note> and demons. I am, O Ráma, thy heart; the goddess of learning is thy
tongue; the gods are the hairs of thy body; the closing of thy eyelids is called the
night: and their opening is called the day. The Vedas are thy Sanskáras.<note
place="foot">Sanskáras are those sacred writings through which the divine commands and
prohibitions are known.</note> Nothing can exist without thee. The whole world is
thy body; the surface of the earth is thy stability.</q>
</p>

<pb n="560"/><anchor id="Pg560"/>

<p>
<q rend="post">O Śrívatsalakshaṇa, fire is thy anger, and the moon is thy favour. In the
time of thy incarnation named Vámana, thou didst pervade the three worlds with thy
three steps; and Mahendra was made the king of paradise by thee having confined
the fearful Bali.<note place="foot">Bali, a demon whom Vámana confined in Pátála.</note>
Sítá (thy wife) is Lakshmí; and thou art the God Vishṇu,<note place="foot">Vishṇu, the
second of the Hindu triad.</note> Krishṇa,<note place="foot">Krishṇa, (black coloured)
one of the ten incarnations of Vishṇu.</note> and Prajápati. To kill Rávaṇ thou hast
assumed the form of a man; therefore, O best of the virtuous, thou hast completed this
task imposed by us (gods). O Ráma, Rávaṇa has been killed by thee: now being joyful
(i.e. having for some time reigned in the kingdom of Ayodhyá,) go to paradise. O glorious
Ráma, thy power and thy valour are never failing. The visit to thee and the
prayers made to thee are never fruitless. Thy devotees will never be unsuccessful.
Thy devotees who obtain thee (thy favour) who art first and best of mankind,
shall obtain their desires in this world as well as in the next. They who recite
this prayer, founded on the Vedas (or first uttered by the sages), and the old and
divine account of (Ráma) shall never suffer defeat.</q>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>Bharat-Miláp</hi> or meeting with Bharat, is the closing scene of
the dramatic representation of Ráma's great victory and triumphant return which
takes place annually in October in many of the cities of Northern India. The
Rám-Lalá or Play of Ráma, as the great drama is called, is performed in the open
air and lasts with one day's break through fifteen successive days. At Benares
there are three nearly simultaneous performances, one provided by H. H. the
Maharajah of Benares near his palace at Ramnaggur, one by H. H. the Maharajah
of Vizianagram near the Missionary settlement at Sigra and at other places in
the city, and one by the leading gentry of the city at Chowká Ghát near the
College. The scene especially on the great day when the brothers meet is most
interesting: the procession of elephants with their gorgeous howdahs of silver and
gold and their magnificently dressed riders with priceless jewels sparkling in their
turbans, the enthusiasm of the thousands of spectators who fill the streets and
squares, the balconies and the housetops, the flowers that are rained down upon
the advancing car, the wild music, the shouting and the joy, make an impression
that is not easily forgotten.

<head>Final Notes.</head>

<p>
I end these notes with an extract which I translate from Signor Gorresio's
Preface to the tenth volume of his Rámáyan, and I take this opportunity of again
thankfully acknowledging my great obligations to this eminent Śanskritist from
whom I have so frequently borrowed. As Mr. Muir has observed, the Bengal recension
which Signor Gorresio has most ably edited is throughout an admirable
commentary on the genuine Rámáyan of northern India, and I have made constant
reference to the faithful and elegant translation which accompanies the text
for assistance and confirmation in difficulties:
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">Towards the southern extremity and in the island of Lanká (Ceylon) there
existed undoubtedly a black and ferocious race, averse to the Aryans and hostile
to their mode of worship: their ramifications extended through the islands of the
Archipelago, and some traces of them remain in Java to this day.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Sanskrit-Indians, applying to this race a name expressive of hatred
which occurs in the Vedas as the name of hostile, savage and detested beings,
called it the Rákshas race: it is against these Rákshases that the expedition of
Ráma which the Rámáyan celebrates is directed. The Sanskrit-Indians certainly
altered in their traditions the real character of this race: they attributed to it
physical and moral qualities not found in human nature; they transformed it
into a race of giants; they represented it as monstrous, hideous, truculent, changing
forms at will, blood-thirsty and ravenous, just as the Semites represented the
races that opposed them as impious, horrible and of monstrous size. But notwithstanding
these mythical exaggerations, which are partly due to the genius of the
Aryans so prone to magnify everything without measure, the Rámáyan in the
course of its epic narration has still preserved and noted here and there some traits
and peculiarities of the race which reveal its true character. It represents the
Rákshases as black of hue, and compares them with black clouds and masses of
black collyrium; it attributes to them curly woolly hair and thick lips, it depicts
them as loaded with chains, collars and girdles of gold, and the other bright ornaments
which their race has always loved, and in which the kindred races of the
Soudan still delight. It describes them as worshippers of matter and force.
They are hostile to the religion of the Aryans whose rites and sacrifices they
disturb and ruin … Such is the Rákshas race as represented in the Rámáyan; and
the war of the Aryan Ráma forms the subject of the epic, a subject certainly real
and historical as far as regards its substance, but greatly exaggerated by the
ancient myth. In Sanskrit-Indian tradition are found traces of another struggle
of the Aryans with the Rákshas races, which preceded the war of Ráma. According
to some pauranic legends, Kárttavírya, a descendant of the royal tribe of the
Yádavas, contemporary with Parasurama and a little anterior to Ráma, attacked
Lanká and took Rávaṇ prisoner. This well shows how ancient and how deeply
rooted in the Aryan race is the thought of this war which the Rámáyan celebrates.
</p>

<pb n="562"/><anchor id="Pg562"/>

<p>
<q>But,</q> says an eminent Indianist<note place="foot">A. Weber,
<hi rend='italic'>Akademische Vorlesungen</hi>, p. 181.</note>
whose learning I highly appreciate,
<q>the Rámáyan is an allegorical epic, and no precise and historical value can be
assigned to it. Sítá signifies the furrow made by the plough, and under this
symbolical aspect has already appeared honoured with worship in the hymns of
the Rig-veda; Ráma is the bearer of the plough (this assertion is entirely gratuitous);
these two allegorical personages represented agriculture introduced to
the southern regions of India by the race of the Kosalas from whom Ráma was
descended; the Rákshases on whom he makes war are races of demons and giants
who have little or nothing human about them; allegory therefore predominates
in the poem, and the exact reality of an historical event must not be looked for
in it.</q> Such is Professor Weber's opinion. If he means to say that mythical
fictions are mingled with real events,
</p>

<lg>
<l>Forsan in alcun vero suo arco percuote,</l>
</lg>

<p>
as Dante says, and I fully concede the point. The interweaving of the myth with
the historical truth belongs to the essence, so to speak, of the primitive epopeia.
If Sítá is born, as the Rámáyan feigns, from the furrow which King Janak opened
when he ploughed the earth, not a whit more real is the origin of Helen and
Æneas as related in Homer and Virgil, and if the characters in the Rámáyan
exceed human nature, and in a greater degree perhaps than is the case in analogous
epics, this springs in part from the nature of the subject and still more from
the symbol-loving genius of the orient. Still the characters of the Rámáyan,
although they exceed more or less the limits of human nature, act notwithstanding
in the course of the poem, speak, feel, rejoice and grieve according to the natural
impulse of human passions. But if by saying that the Rámáyan is an allegorical
epic, it is meant that its fundamental subject is nothing but allegory, that the war
of the Aryan Ráma against the Rákshas race is an allegory, that the conquest of
the southern region and of the island of Lanká is an allegory, I do not hesitate
to answer that such a presumption cannot be admitted and that the thing is in my
opinion impossible. Father Paolíno da S. Bartolommeo,<note place="foot">Systema
brahmanicum, liturgicum, mythologicum, civile, exmonumentis
Indicis, etc.</note> had already, together
with other strange opinions of his own on Indian matters, brought forward a
similar idea, that is to say that the exploit of Ráma which is the subject of the
Rámáyan was a symbol and represented the course of the sun: thus he imagined
that Brahmá was the earth, Vishṇu the water, and that his avatárs were the
blessings brought by the fertilizing waters, etc. But such ideas, born at a time
when Indo-sanskrit antiquities were enveloped in darkness, have been dissipated
by the light of new studies. How could an epic so dear in India to the memory
of the people, so deeply rooted for many centuries in the minds of all, so propagated
and diffused through all the dialects and languages of those regions,
which had become the source of many dramas which are still represented in
India, which is itself represented every year with such magnificence and to such
crowds of people in the neighbourhood of Ayodhyá, a poem welcomed at its very
birth with such favour, as the legend relates, that the recitation of it by the first
wandering Rhapsodists has consecrated and made famous all the places celebrated
<pb n="563"/><anchor id="Pg563"/>
by them, and where Ráma made a shorter or longer stay, how, I ask, could such
an epic have been purely allegorical? How, upon a pure invention, upon a simple
allegory, could a poem have been composed of about fifty thousand verses, relating
with such force and power the events, and giving details with such exactness?
On a theme purely allegorical there may easily be composed a short mythical
poem, as for example a poem on Proserpine or Psyche: but never an epic so full
of traditions and historical memories, so intimately connected with the life of
the people, as the Rámáyan.<note place="foot">Not only have the races of India
translated or epitomized it, but foreign nations have appropriated it wholly or in
part, Persia, Java, and Japan itself.</note> Excessive readiness to find allegory
whenever some traces of symbolism occur, where the myth partly veils the historical
reality, may lead and often has led to error. What poetical work of mythical times could
stand this mode of trial? could there not be made, or rather has there not been
made a work altogether allegorical, out of the Homeric poems? We have all
heard of the ingenious idea of the anonymous writer, who in order to prove how
easily we may pass beyond the truth in our wish to seek and find allegory everywhere,
undertook with keen subtlety to prove that the great personality of
Napoleon I. was altogether allegorical and represented the sun. Napoleon was
born in an island, his course was from west to east, his twelve marshals were the
twelve signs of the zodiac, etc.
</p>

<p>
I conclude then, that the fundamental theme of the Rámáyan, that is to
say the war of the Aryan Ráma against the Rákshases, an Hamitic race settled
in the south, ought to be regarded as real and historical as far as regards its
substance, although the mythic element intermingled with the true sometimes alters
its natural and genuine aspect.
</p>

<p>
How then did the Indo-Sanskrit epopeia form and complete itself? What
elements did it interweave in its progress? How did it embody, how did it clothe
the naked and simple primitive datum? We must first of all remember that the
Indo-European races possessed the epic genius in the highest degree, and that
they alone in the different regions they occupied produced epic poetry … But other
causes and particular influences combined to nourish and develop the epic germ
of the Sanskrit-Indians. Already in the Rig-veda are found hymns in which the
Aryan genius preluded, so to speak, to the future epopeia, in songs that celebrated
the heroic deeds of Indra, the combats and the victories of the tutelary Gods
of the Aryan races over enemies secret or open, human or superhuman, the exploits
and the memories of ancient heroes. More recently, at certain solemn
occasions, as the very learned A. Weber remarks, at the solemnity, for example
of the Aśvamedha or sacrifice of the horse, the praises of the king who ordained
the great rite were sung by bards and minstrels in songs composed for the purpose,
the memories of past times were recalled and honourable mention was made
of the just and pious kings of old. In the <hi rend='italic'>Bráhmaṇas</hi>, a sort of
prose commentaries annexed to the Vedas, are found recorded stories and legends which
allude to historical events of the past ages, to ancient memories, and to mythical
events. Such popular legends which the <hi rend='italic'>Bráhmaṇas</hi> undoubtedly
gathered from tradition admirably suited the epic tissue with which they were interwoven
by successive hands.… Many and various mythico-historical traditions, suitable for
epic development, were diffused among the Aryan races, those for example which are
related
<pb n="564"/><anchor id="Pg564"/>
in the four chapters containing the description of the earth, the Descent of the
Ganges, etc. The epic genius however sometimes created beings of its own and
gave body and life to ideal conceptions. Some of the persons in the Rámáyan
must be, in my opinion, either personifications of the forces of nature like those
which are described with such vigour in the <hi rend='italic'>Sháhnámah</hi>, or if not
exactly created, exaggerated beyond human proportions; others, vedic personages much more
ancient than Ráma, were introduced into the epic and woven into its narrations, to
bring together men who lived in different and distant ages, as has been the case
in times nearer to our own, in the epics, I mean, of the middle ages.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post">In the introduction I have discussed the antiquity of the Rámáyan;
and by means of those critical and inductive proofs which are all that an
antiquity without precise historical dates can furnish I have endeavoured to
establish with all the certainty that the subject admitted, that the original
composition of the Rámáyan is to be assigned to about the twelfth century before
the Christian era. Not that I believe that the epic then sprang to life in the
form in which we now possess it; I think, and I have elsewhere expressed the
opinion, that the poem during the course of its rhapsodical and oral propagation
appropriated by way of episodes, traditions, legends and ancient myths.… But
as far as regards the epic poem properly so called which celebrates the expedition
of Ráma against the Rákshases I think that I have sufficiently shown that
its origin and first appearance should be placed about the twelfth century B.C.;
nor have I hitherto met with anything to oppose this chronological result, or to
oblige me to rectify or reject it.… But an eminent philologist already quoted,
deeply versed in these studies, A. Weber, has expressed in some of his writings a
totally different opinion; and the authority of his name, if not the number and
cogency of his arguments, compels me to say something on the subject. From
the fact or rather the assumption that Megasthenes<note place="foot">In the third
century B.C.</note> who lived some time in
India has made no mention either of the Mahábhárat or the Rámáyan Professor
Weber argues that neither of these poems could have existed at that time; as regards
the Rámáyan, the unity of its composition, the chain that binds together
its different parts, and its allegorical character, show it, says Professor Weber, to
be much more recent than the age to which I have assigned it, near to our own
era, and according to him, later than the Mahábhárat. As for Megasthenes it
should be observed, that he did not write a history of India, much less a literary
history or anything at all resembling one, but a simple description, in great part
physical, of India: whence, from his silence on literary matters to draw inferences
regarding the history of Sanskrit literature would be the same thing as
from the silence of a geologist with respect to the literature of a country whose
valleys, mountains, and internal structure he is exploring, to conjecture that such
and such a poem or history not mentioned by him did not exist at his time. We
have only to look at the fragments of Megasthenes collected and published by
Schwanbeck to see what was the nature and scope of his <hi rend='italic'>Indica</hi>.…
But only a few fragments of Megasthenes are extant; and to pretend that they
should be argument and proof enough to judge the antiquity of a poem is to press
the laws of criticism too far. To Professor Weber's argument as to the more or
<pb n="565"/><anchor id="Pg565"/>
less recent age of the Rámáyan from the unity of its composition, I will make
one sole reply, which is that if unity of composition were really a proof of a more
recent age, it would be necessary to reduce by a thousand years at least the age
of Homer and bring him down to the age of Augustus and Virgil; for certainly
there is much more unity of composition, a greater accord and harmony of parts
in the Iliad and the Odyssey than in the Rámáyan. But in the fine arts perfection
is no proof of a recent age: while the experience and the continuous labour
of successive ages are necessary to extend and perfect the physical or natural
sciences, art which is spontaneous in its nature can produce and has produced in
remote times works of such perfection as later ages have not been able to equal.</q>
